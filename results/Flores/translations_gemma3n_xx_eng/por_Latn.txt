The American gymnastics team supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute necessity of the Olympic family promoting a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, may be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well-accepted, but also offers details not often found in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was light or carotenoid-colored.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as rachies, do not have a well-developed shaft, but possess other features, such as barbs and barbules. In light of this, researchers concluded that the rachis was possibly the result of evolutionary development subsequent to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not a juvenile.
Researchers suggested that, despite the tail being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not down.
In the morning of yesterday, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work done was, for the most part, theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the galaxy of Sagittarius.
The effect the team was seeking would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo surrounding the galaxy and is composed of various minuscule particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather rigorous manner.
Since 1988, voting ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added, with the exception of those from voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, achieved tenth place in the seated women's group with a combined result of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the first-place finisher, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers from the group were unable to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, stated Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is under custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence of eyewitness testimony may be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary acts differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally in charge of the cases, has told journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine seeks based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other matters covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were under close supervision of the forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth ZIP code in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the electoral court as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was the response given by Martelly to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 7:19 AM local time. At GMT, it was on Friday at 9:19 PM.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reported damages in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held the passengers hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with the Filipino photographers.
After that, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
Your research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even crazier... I loved her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those who oppose the change for Australia to become a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
The then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people have verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software, in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic material that could develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, given that comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his administration at the start of this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political maneuvering and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no extra transportation, and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and connections to public transportation will not be available.
The lack of transportation problem has increased the possibility of the game having to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of fans.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can even be rolled into small forms.
It is possible to stretch it into a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be very thin and adhered to another metal. Because it was so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted frames in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH. You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a type of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a flushing system in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnant parts of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
A giant rocket, over 30 meters tall, is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was give us much easier and faster transportation.
They gave us the train, the car, and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat small animals, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and offspring.
Women often have close relationships with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced animal, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a series of shouted and growled words.
Opossums like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the opossum hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population they came from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics than it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expel).
Plants use sunlight as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using wood and make our clothes using cotton. The majority of the food we consume are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of its era, therefore, the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We are not certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would be no match for him.
Although most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the arganaz.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating.
The diet in ancient Rome did not include foodstuffs originating from America and Asia for Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the house of their respective deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't that important.
Most of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized in a scattered manner. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it so.
But, regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've already seen the movie *The Legend of the Lost Treasure*, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its existence, the great parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. The culture of a civilization derives from the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural reach, and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to demand taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who generally did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to revoke tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states gave the central government so little importance that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is frequently referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago."
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans navigating the region christened the place Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the grain production practices of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the grounds of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were like originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this restoration continues to this day.
As an example, the most common format of still image photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the film size with the most circulation at the end of the era of analog film.
Currently, it is still produced; however, the most important thing is that its proportion has been inherited by image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, in fact, confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the lowest ratio of integers) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close to that proportion.
The quite abused and frequently demoralized law of third parties is a rather simple guideline that provides a dynamic while also maintaining a relative order within a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by his influential power, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The church's central leadership was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, with the cut-off of vital supplies to military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations stipulated in various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to ships flying neutral flags.
Germany, having found limited response to that tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with nothing but a pocketful of pennies, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous employment) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, following the Revolution, positions were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful individuals to succeed.
The same is true for the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, features several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-pointing arch" mark resembles a V, and the "downward-pointing arch" mark resembles a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and pull the bow; down means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, drawing the bow upwards produces a softer sound, while drawing it downwards produces a louder and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed staff notation exists for a musical reason, therefore these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, eleven years old, and Luis Carlos, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, leaving Versailles, by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a demonstrator waved the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banking houses.
It is clear that the superprofits generated from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of North American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a series of ideas in practice, from the provision of technology or technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by a logic underlying associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that technological development follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; second, that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that automobiles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which drives the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Geography, within the context of Romanticism, led to citizens being shaped and to customs and culture linked to that geography emerging over time, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became better than any eventually mandatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century primarily because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic language reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is farming practiced to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, generally organic system that uses locally sourced native seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few regrettable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
These children are called "ferocious" or wild. Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children occurred due to the parents' rejection of the child because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious traumas or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is assumed that others were created by animals; it is said that some lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the domestic animal, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support for students who are experiencing a new learning situation, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical; in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that talking clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software with the aim of questioning, alerting, and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but it happens.
We see the Family Support System as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has the responsibility of providing safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
It is assumed that foster care will meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it is alleged that a person can detect if another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Discourse," indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: cryptic and overt.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its amino acid requirements by consuming the available plant resources.
Furthermore, not taking action according to [something] leads to serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death. (Note: The original Portuguese sentence is a bit ambiguous as to what "agir de acordo" refers to. I've translated it as "taking action according to [something]" to reflect this ambiguity.)
Plant-based resources with greater accessibility would be proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us, primates, to digest unless they are cooked.
However, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, it wouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in much the same way that current savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterward (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without fully waking him up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm while you sleep, it can be placed at the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates inversely with their level of physical and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and indeed there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The work of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the capacity to move population and goods while, at the same time, interfering with the capacity of their enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At that very moment, the German Navy was, above all using U-boats, attempting to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have had the capacity to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by herders who were typically children or adolescents, similar to the most well-known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England starting from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry heavier loads on the somewhat rougher roads.
Sleepers were implemented right at the beginning to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became apparent that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cap on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first means of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Adaptations for bipedalism are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more friendly way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
That's exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the root cause of the problems and eliminate them.
It's obvious enough that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and problems have become larger because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by President of the Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly paws and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest clue of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with lice, which are insects quite structured for clinging to humans.
Both barberfish and barnacles are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and adult people.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their interest, or in their child's.
Such couples have permission to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It's not, in fact, merely experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior typically depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a continuous cycle period, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments: one to label the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other to label the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns in the interior to go to work in other cities, and they encounter other people who work precisely in those small towns from which they came.
In this dynamic transportation bus, everyone is in some way connected and supporting a private car-based transportation system.
Science points today that this carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest in the world. It carries more than eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes nearly 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or in the excellence of their construction techniques.
The ancient people of Egypt during the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Calcium and potassium are considered elements, not metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil became relegated to a less important role and use.
Currently, people write messages using computer screens and don't need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works based on the principle that energy is required to create a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's more or less like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The nucleus division then releases a little of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner beneath the seas and thicker below the mountains.
There might be more mareo on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people possess certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what's within certain people that makes them want to do what they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin leading their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum tries to maintain themselves as "part of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an individual impossible to recognize, feeling that they must change everything the team has been doing and do their own thing.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior repeatedly leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team typically act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be located in different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, an organization's process of working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Even before an organization becomes innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between cerebral and behavioral pathology underpins scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before observed.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Despite AI having a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
The examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as recognition of written, spoken, and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is frequently used in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it is integrated into various software applications on home computers and video games.
Study trips are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is revamped, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often begin their interaction with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing in blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content in an active way, students can position themselves within the context of others' writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north, however, boasts the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Due to all of this and much more, Ontario stands out as what people from outside consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited.
For comparison purposes, which surprises many people, there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, at a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest, and a continent in itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advisable for all female travelers to say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women must understand that cultural differences can lead to actions they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's due to cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which received the name Casablanca from the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any trip outside of Goma should be carefully considered to understand the ongoing state of the conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable gorilla trekking trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (mototaxi) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, given its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was listed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates, broadcast on the PBS channel.
The city strongly contrasts with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 Km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the banner of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as is the case with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to get a Wild Card. With it, you can gain access to several parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar graph made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront, on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonizers chose to live, and therefore, if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just made up of mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain still remaining.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², with one-third of it covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the interdistric railway station (on the other side of the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are almost always crowded, it's advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and durable Japanese coastal minibuses.
Ride-sharing taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two runways 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to go into operation in September 2017, the date anticipated for the completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has successfully maintained many of the characteristics and identity of its indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay updated on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to a British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, it's unlikely that credit cards are accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Please check with the owners in advance to find out which method of payment they accept.
It's practically impossible to change currency in the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it's summer there, while it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There aren't particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't get close.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife; therefore, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 lives of Germans and Americans were lost.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being situated between two bays. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are, at times, crowded, familiar beaches with a large variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not an elaborate beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines go down easier.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're hesitant.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Continue heeding the authorities' reminders, obeying all signs, and paying close attention to safety alerts.
The box jellyfish occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks really exist, but rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, even though it's likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these should first be forwarded to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive earlier to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the music ends on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue playing late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as crossing the ice generates an awful noise for those who are sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They generally have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on site.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Whenever someone is going to drive in areas with high latitudes or on mountain roads, they should take into consideration the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, it's possible to accumulate enough snow to trap you in a very short time.
Visibility can also decrease due to falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari," in its colloquial use, refers to land trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, mainly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and basic equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walk in the forest," "walking safari," or "trek," a walking safari is equivalent to hiking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like using socks with holes, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of the filters varies, and if you're unsure, it might be a good idea to consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases that are unfamiliar to them in the regions they came from.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the chance to buy goods exempt from taxes and fees in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep descents, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are visibly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections – typically 55-65 km/h – and strict adherence to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria they are elaborate and varied, similar to those in the neighboring south, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, with baked apples appearing year-round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes usually pair very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, yet delicious pastries, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a wide array encompassing a great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant Javanese condiments being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
To provide support for a rider's feet, stirrups are used, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can pose safety problems as the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a knight is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal ends up fleeing. To reduce this danger, various safety precautions can be taken.
First, a large portion of riders use riding boots with a heel and smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling off.
Being the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite cliffs and rock faces.
The meetings include exciting perspectives from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes within their infinite potential of cliffs.
Sports practiced in the snow, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity for many enthusiasts on their trips, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was established by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It's related, but it generally doesn't involve ski touring or mountaineering tourism, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good condition, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot — but you will only rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions like a country in that respect.
If you stay in this area, it's possible to cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you won't need to apply for visas for each of the member states of the Schengen area separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in mass quantities.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other professional classes.
Even though it's a tradition, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you will be visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also advisable to consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is given to their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may experience different situations than those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The viewpoints presented are typically superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary depending on the geographical location, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of a harsh climate, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, as well as snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any weather risks in their region, as this could affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country considered a war zone, a person should first receive professional training.
A search on the internet for 'Hostile environment course' will typically indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid techniques, and sometimes training with the use of weapons.
Books and magazines about jungle survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undefined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender-affirming surgery should not have to wait to be scanned with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the reflux of water from waves on the beach returning to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid deep-water current can form there.
The majority of deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to break free from the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than it normally would be.
Try to aim from somewhere you can't be caught, or, depending on your skills or if you've been detected, wait for rescue.
The reentry shock occurs sooner than the culture shock (honeymoon period lasts less time), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also fundamental for travelers returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the light and sound show of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is defined as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The rest refer to Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains range, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a cell phone, as you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone company can provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who graduate from school, allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can indeed increase your chances of entering higher education in your country of origin.
Normally, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Despite coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes being large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a differentiated experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is agreed upon by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but a quite characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number ranges from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or haven't experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Freight companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Frequently, time is very important when shipping commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there has been a problem.
If they shipped things by air freight, depending on the route, it could take days to arrive at the destination and clear customs.
The only way to expedite the process was to ship it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is by shelling out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, having your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as a basic rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it's not worth even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are very well aware that there is a small group of passengers willing to pay a premium for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of the Mediterranean Europe than classical Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's tombs.
It's worth walking for half an hour through the intriguing village.
To the north, and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after an exuberant account of its splendors was written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus frequently travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Relicarium), a world-famous place for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are basically visiting a huge cemetery, as well as a place that has virtually incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, whose loved ones were murdered or who died working there.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by defacing or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large part understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as the official language.
Even so, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular ads on the subway are only done in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inappropriate stereotype, the best way to do well in Paris is still to behave well, act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will considerably facilitate your trip.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to varied microclimates, different soils, and different altitude levels.
The area also shelters a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and tetraopes, as well as various other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide clothing for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own attire, especially with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
It's possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there's a one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available ingredient, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
That also makes reading easier, without a doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used substantively.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Furthermore, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means automobile.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mainly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it's not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated nowadays and remain in museums or schools.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem in its heyday, they often meet in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas that offer favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" seedling.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in you being expelled, without the right to discuss it.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the Equator, you will need to deal with both the heat (constant) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland watercourses can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, or taking a boat trip to the points of interest on the Danube, or sailing on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There's a tradition in some places of spending Easter night awake in an open area to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The most traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky gets dark around the right time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
In Japan, labor cultural relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire in business, and colleagues call each other by their last names or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing teamwork over celebrating individual achievements.
Workers generally need the approval of their superiors for all the decisions they make, and it is expected that they obey their superiors' instructions without question.
