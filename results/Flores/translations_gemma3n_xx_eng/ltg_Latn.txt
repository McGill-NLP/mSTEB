When a group of living organisms (population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they are isolated by a mountain range or a river, or created by a new road so that they cannot be easily reunited), their seeds will be in another group, later or earlier.
The new environment has diverse resources and diverse competitors, therefore the new inhabitants will need other functions or adaptations to be able to be competitive.
The population's basic needs haven't changed, so they still need the same adjustments as before.
In time, as young settlers face a new environment, they gradually become more and more similar to the local population.
Over thousands or even millions of years, the population will evolve so differently that you won't even be able to call them the same species, let alone the same kind.
We call this process specialization, which is usually associated with the formation of new species. Specialization is a crucial and very important part of evolutionary history.
