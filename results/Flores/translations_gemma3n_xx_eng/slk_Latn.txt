Not only does this confirm the already widely accepted theory that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, but it also provides details about what fossils were generally unable to offer, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The finding also provides a detailed view of the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed backbone called a rachis, but possess other feather features – barbs and vanes – scientists concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. According to scientists, even though this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers from an adult individual and not down from a hatchling.
Even though it's about the tail of a young dinosaur, scientists say the specimen has feathers of an adult individual, not down feathers of a juvenile.

The work they carried out was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that the interaction of one dark matter with another dark matter is the same as that of ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy and is made up of a large number of small particles.

The government also promised several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare healthcare facilities for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the regions most severely affected historically this year have been postponed due to a lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

"Its thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), who also works at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally low-tech. Voters went to a separate room and placed a pre-printed slip of paper with the name of their candidate in a ballot box.
When the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has a relatively strict code of conduct.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except those inserted by properly verified and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with specific procedures.

The police of Madhya Pradesh managed to recover a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
D. K. Arya, Deputy Chief Inspector, said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss citizen and stole her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
While the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Then Adekoyu was charged by the sheriff's court in Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She is in custody and awaiting indictment and trial, however, any evidence from eyewitnesses may be compromised because her likeness has been widely disseminated.
This is common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee claims that "journalists are going down a dangerous path if they publish photographs of suspicious individuals."
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for criminal proceedings, has indicated to journalists that it will not comment further on the case until at least charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document is expected to concern the dispute over the demarcation of borders that Palestine demands based on the border situation before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Among other topics being discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which both peoples consider holy, and also the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, after signing the agreement, demands a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary test against pests were to be under strict supervision of foresters, as the test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In the partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were accepted within the association's Sporting Shooters Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the park for protection and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday appointed a new, nine-member interim electoral commission (CEP) to office.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the pre-agreed resignation of the interim electoral board as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelli's reaction to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been taking place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods were reported, which together caused six fires and four people suffered minor burns as a result.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving facilities.
Last week, the Japanese government agency METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company described as "minor."
The Ministry responded by calling the postponement of the Apple report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
The Office for Emergency Situations in the Northern Mariana Islands announced that no damages had been reported in the territory.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center's statement, there is no indication that a tsunami wave will occur.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Along with Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly people, were also released early.
Then the photographers took the place of the elderly lady who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in the city of Auckland.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins started studying premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that administering homone would accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, so-called "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Comrades also paid homage to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager. She died in the night of two moons, which was rather original, fitting for her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented with the words: "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's doing well up there."
Of the 1400 people who participated in a survey before the federal elections in 2010, the number of people who are against Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated during the campaign leading up to the 2010 federal election her conviction that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
In the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of respondents think that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold Olympic medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games and also participate in three relays, but due to his complaints, doubts arose regarding his fitness.
He couldn't take the necessary medication for pain because it is prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the invention by early February using different hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have likely been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the gossip as "political delusion and folly".
It is assumed that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes and thereby save millions of liters of fuel and reduce carbon emissions annually.
It utilizes satellite technology, unlike older technology based on ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to more precisely identify aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no other type of transport available; there are no above-ground trains stopping in Wembley, and neither are parking lots or park-and-ride facilities available.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
On Thursday, a study was published in the journal Science reporting the emergence of a new species of birds on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new animal species has been able to evolve in just two generations, despite it being believed that this process would take much longer. This was achieved through the crossbreeding of the endemic Darwin's finch *Geospiza fortes* and the migratory cactus finch *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into various forms. It can, for example, be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It is possible to produce something very thin and it can be glued onto another metal. It is possible to make it so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating handmade images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be made using beetroot juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powders, and then form a small ball with them using clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will begin to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange feeling and the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets connected to a sophisticated drainage system in almost every house.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in houses of the Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were not lacking. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
You use a satellite to talk to someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
A satellite in space receives a call, which it then almost immediately reflects back down to Earth.
A rocket launched the satellite into space. Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and field of view.
To get a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, taller than 30 meters.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most significant thing the wheel brought us is much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to that, we have a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cat-like predators that feed on medium-sized prey – from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a much larger variety of small prey than just insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of so-called "niche," meaning specific areas or tasks that each member is responsible for, which prevents mutual competition.
Lions are the most social feline predators; they live in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually closely connected to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions in their behavior (though not other feline predators). They are also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger, being a well-trained athlete, knows how to climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's roar with a mighty voice, but rather like a few hoarse, shouted words.
Ocelots readily eat small animals. Occasionally, they manage to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. However, the vast majority of the animals that ocelots hunt are significantly smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots stalk and seek out animals to eat (prey), based on scent and by sniffing areas where they have been.
Ocelots have very good night vision, allowing them to see well in the dark, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) breaks away from the main population it originated from (such as when they move across a mountain range, a river, or when they migrate to a new island, making it difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment that differs from the original one.
This new environment has various resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will increasingly resemble members of other populations less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which means simply the development of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes, as well as to produce clothing. Most of what we consume has a plant origin. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were fitted with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We are not completely sure, but he may have had a tongue shaped like a fork. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been cannibalistic.
It also swallowed everything that entered the water. Not even a giant dinosaur, for example a Tyrannosaurus Rex, could match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor, including women, ate while sitting on stools, whereas wealthy men preferred communal feasts where they consumed food while lounging beside each other.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not have contained ingredients that did not reach Europe until centuries later from America or Asia.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted monkfish.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the deity.
People were accustomed to offering sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strived to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes, temples also included specially built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
A house wasn't that essential in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of her life was spent by an ordinary Jewish family under the open sky.
Women cooked in the yard, and the shops consisted only of counters open towards the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Scandinavian sagas tell of Erik the Red being exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed further west, he discovered a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are considered "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history.
If you watched the movie Treasure of the Templars, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a map to treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document upside down.
While no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that in its early days it was a large parchment document (of dimensions 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the record served only to label the document.
The landings in Normandy and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
"Vichy" Frenchmen ruled there. These were the French who made a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an assault into southern France. The invasion was codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned their attention towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant population of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word *civilis*, which means citizenly, and this word is related to the Latin word *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and this also defines the size of a society in a certain way.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilizational culture brings with it the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of cultural heritage, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, thirteen states initially created a weak central government according to the Articles of Confederation, the sole component of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to levy taxes. And since there was no national executive power or judiciary, the Congress relied on state authorities to enforce all of its laws. However, these often failed to cooperate.
It also had no authority to rewrite the laws on tax and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions; Italians compete in international and Olympic events.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often considered a "nation of islands" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southwestern Taiwan, began transforming practices of cultivating native grains, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex's perimeter were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the original buildings looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1975, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photograph format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensors of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35mm format surprisingly has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Due to the aspect ratio of this format, which is divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers, it is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are equal to or closely approach this aspect ratio.
The widely used, yet often ridiculed, rule of thirds creates dynamics while maintaining a sense of balanced order.
He claims that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, having become wealthy and powerful.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound European countries together, despite differences in languages and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone, from the king to the common person.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds should be used precisely for these purposes.
The Church has been present as a central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether its principles are upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it managed to disrupt vital military and civilian supplies. This was despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since there was only a minimal reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among a large portion of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
When the world witnessed the horrors and atrocities committed during World War I, nations longed to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison Company in New York.
Charles Batchelor, his former manager, who had recommended him to Thomas Edison, came to the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter.
Ancient China was known for a unique way of depicting different periods; each historical period of China, or each family that held power, was a dynasty that left a significant mark on history.
Between each dynasty was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a cruel war raged between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in the battles for the highest position in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
Many social and political phenomena are discernible, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from self-rule to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were available to all male applicants, thus enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as instead of being based on class, military ranks have shifted to caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters transcending earthly life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying on the summit of one of the peaks in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to get to it, even if someone knew where it was located. As soon as you find yourself in the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing is visible but the clear, beautiful sky and a multitude of surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The plateau of Giza, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza," is located in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings. Here you can see several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arrow pointing up" symbol looks like a V, and the "arrow pointing down" symbol looks like a clip or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you should start from the tip and pull on the bow, while down means you should start from the frog (the place where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bowstring.
The upper part of the meadow usually creates a softer sound, while the lower part of the meadow is firmer and more resilient.
You can calmly write down your own markings, but don't forget that printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually preserve them.
A mob of market women drove the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris by car, accompanied by an angry crowd of shouting people who threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one moment, someone in the crowd shook their head at the terrified queen, referring to the royal guard who were executed in Versailles.
The Filipino people alone paid for the war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover the majority of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government, which were channeled through Wall Street banks.
It is clear that the enormous profits gained through the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which those events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an epoch in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of concepts, from the development of new technologies or the technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology "affects" societies in ways that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
The national road network, however, is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed with the aim of reducing the costs associated with car ownership.
Fleet ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which drives the development of new techniques in healthcare to heal injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawing on authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to geography emerged, which were in harmony with society and were superior to arbitrarily established laws.
Just as Paris is currently considered the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the one during the period of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century. The main reason for this was the return of the Crusaders, who brought gifts such as silk and spices, and these were more valued than what was offered on Byzantine markets.
At that very time, the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East significantly influenced clothing.
Due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. Among the greatest achievements of that time, brought about by the Crusades, are buttons. They began to be used for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out for the purpose of producing only the amount of food necessary to feed the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that utilizes locally saved seed – originating from the ecoregion – in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnic origin, social class, geographical location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that define a distinct subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often display their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or intentionally abused and not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "untamed" or wild. Some untamed children were restricted (usually by their own parents); in some cases, parents abandoned the child because they could not cope with their significant intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
They were supposedly further raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If a wild child is raised only by animals other than human beings, its behavior (within physical limits) is almost the same as the behavior of a specific animal, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is intended to facilitate learning and make it more engaging, a strategy called "scaffolding" goes even further.
Scaffolding (building scaffolding) is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that helps people who encounter new experiences while learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
"Scaffolding" can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is also a form of "scaffolding," but so is a small office staple in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software. It is primarily intended to challenge and explain overly complex procedures to the student that they would not be able to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, yet this happens.
We perceive it as a safe zone for these children, that the foster care system represents.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide children with everything they needed that was lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique properties of the internet lead to further possibilities in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, it is assumed that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "lasting relationships" as motivating factors.
The use of video recordings led to significant revelations in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More precisely, it is claimed that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
In his work "The President's речь", Oliver Sacks showed that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess the sincerity of expression.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals as well, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations between these two populations with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to satisfy their need to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
If you do not do so, it will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based sources were probably the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but those are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all essential amino acids.
If we consider everything, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep disruption is a process that involves intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and then falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
You can achieve this easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up without fully waking you.
However, if you keep hitting the snooze button, you can place it across the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms is drinking a large amount of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The degree of inner peace a person has is indirectly related to the tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded through the Mahayana path of love and various techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is essentially very simple and encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, these Allied countries diverged ideologically precisely because of the clash of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would take another 40 years and the struggle for it really continued through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive line had already been broken, and its only hope was a retreat and a change in position along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became virtually obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army violated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, and invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus creating a Belarusian and Ukrainian front.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods. At the same time, however, they were to prevent your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop these movements mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and they were often herded by goat herders, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the generally known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Bambers were introduced relatively early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was later found that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron railway tracks were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport is walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (upright man) evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, didn't usually walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations are found in the fossils of australopithecines from the period 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more considerately towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering to some extent in the future.
As in many cases, it's about something like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should address the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humankind, and overpopulation and an extravagant lifestyle are only worsening these problems.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft was sent a few blocks further to John Dunlap's printing house, signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
During the course of one night, 150 to 200 copies were made. They are currently known as "Dunlap's side panels."
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon and took place on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap side pages still exist and are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But with birds, there are many things that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two back legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't have to be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The quickest sign that it's an overdose is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the instructions for first aid regarding this specific poisoning on the label.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" for this group of insects in the formal sense of the word.
This name originates from an old knowledge of the bed bug, which is an insect highly adapted for parasitizing on humans.
Earwigs and pill bugs are insidious, adapted to living in nests or located on their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading neurological disorders in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that the likelihood of developing MS in women is twice as high as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to create a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over the care of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works using scientific methods. These methods actually drive most scientific research.
However, it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observations during observation can also help guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific findings, including those in the field of psychology, were accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms often critically depend on the presence of internal cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, regular rhythms are documented that are not merely reactions to external, repeating signals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that will continue to operate in a free-running cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was among the main evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to inject their DNA into the bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on their type, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
As an example, one could mention tours, photography, and exploring the organ caves of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns for work, and others pass through them who work where the first ones just came from.
In this shuttle transport, everyone is in some way linked to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now suggests that this massive "carbon" economy has pushed the stable state of the biosphere that supported human development for the last two million years out of equilibrium.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate a large number of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and monitoring their mutual interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore traffic flows, which can be approximately mathematically represented, also behave consistently often.
For a more illustrative representation of the traffic flow, relationships were defined between these three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
This offers them a wider selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought she was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't appear that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom. However, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed, neither in size nor in the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population.
Italian is used in the Vatican for official communication and in legal regulations.
Italian is also used daily by most people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because all of them can be found in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily mined using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. Nevertheless, he believed that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, when newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to the sidelines and used less and less.
People now leave messages on computer screens and never have to get close to the grater.
Maybe it's just worth thinking about what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A splitting bomb utilizes the principle that energy is required to assemble a core with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Something similar to rolling a heavy cart uphill. When the core is split again, a portion of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei. This means they are prone to decay with even the slightest or no nudge.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the far side and 100 km on the near side.
It is thinner under the meadow and thicker under the summit.
On the near side, there may be more lunar maria because the crust is thinner, allowing lava to reach the surface more easily.
Content theories are focused on finding what drives people's behavior or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized in adulthood.
These theories focus on what motivates people to do certain things and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there can be two types of behavior when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain in the "one of the guys" (or buddy) position.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and even with responsibility towards people.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual with the feeling that they must change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams are governed by the same quality standards, although with minor differences.
Members of the virtual team mostly serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique part of the virtual team is also the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The Invisible Team" is the governing team to which all members are subject. The Invisible Team also sets the conditions for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals in implementing concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the organization's departments, doors open to creativity and ingenuity.
The collaboration process within the organization aimed at overcoming an obstacle can subsequently lead to a new, innovative process that helps satisfy customer needs.
An organization can be innovative, but first, management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
The film Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. This narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our mind.
AI has a strong connotation of science fiction and forms a significant branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
Research in the field of UI (User Interface) involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
The cases include inspection, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These became independent disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, mechanical engineering, and the military, as it has been integrated into several applications on home computers and in video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every class's life. The teacher would often want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire magnificent works of art while sitting in class with their classmates.
An excellent way to consider a trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the excursion virtually.
Each year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but older versions are kept online to serve as a logbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to become more skilled and to pursue their interests (This, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "enables students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of writings by others as well as outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming "bilingual" capital of Canada and offers visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing its past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the untouched natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All of these and other things highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: More African Americans live in the USA than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in itself, a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to countries, and it was embraced with great enthusiasm on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female passengers are advised to claim they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Even wearing a ring is useful (but only one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment. It is not uncommon for people to stare at you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and served under the name Anfa as a strategic port for Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, abandoning it in 1755 after the earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dār al-Bajdá, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, you should do research before traveling outside of Goma to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for hikes up Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around Goma city, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" has begun to be used as a metaphor to denote relatively inaccessible, exotic, and remote countries.
Currently, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although it is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation. There is also an airport located there.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates during the PBS special "Africa's Wonders."
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as its appearance is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) in the northeast of South Africa stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here, too, there is a fee for daily park maintenance and entrance fees, just as in all South African national parks.
The most advantageous option might be to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a selected number of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
According to the island of Hong Kong, the entire region is called Hong Kong and it is a place that is a major focal point of interest for many tourists.
The collection of buildings that form the contours of Hong Kong could be compared to a radiant bar graph visible from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful view of Hong Kong, you have to leave the island and head across to the Kowloon coast.
The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that British colonizers appropriated, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the coast from the Bangladeshi and Indian mainland.
Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. Part of the forest on the Indian territory is designated as Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not limited to mangrove swamps; they also include some of the last remaining remnants of mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans stretches over an area of 3,850 km², with approximately one-third of it being waterlogged/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of wilderness, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
It is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers soar to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not put into operation until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, by then the Brazilian customs checkpoints should be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous population group. They inhabited the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India," came into being as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best national polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in the Las Cañitas area.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
Information about polo tournaments and ticket purchase options can be found on the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set as equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and US currency may be; be sure to check this in advance with the owners to find out what payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Despite many animals in the park being accustomed to the presence of people, wildlife remains wild and we should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how peaceful they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't maintain a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given space.
It should also be noted that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking or carrying aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notoriously infamous naval incident in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the town led to the killing of the highest chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The boundary defined by two harbors in Auckland allows for the existence of many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them offer shade from umbrella pines.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the central Auckland area.
It's about occasionally crowded beaches for families with plenty of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called Manta.
Many French wines can be found, on the other hand, New Zealand and Australian wines might be more readily available.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink. However, if you have any concerns, getting bottled water is not a problem.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino is served with a thick layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips to the cliff take place, and injuries resulting from these causes on the cliff are rare.
Despite this, follow the instructions of the relevant authorities, pay attention to traffic signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They occasionally appear outside of this period as well.
Sharks really exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean; their usual habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels. However, they also offer the option to book other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers/to the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., visas).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be directed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even when the musical performance ends on the main stages, music may play until late at night in some parts of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are traveling through northern the Baltic region during the winter, check the location of the hut, as walking on the ice causes a rather terrible noise to those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include an overnight stay in the city. Passengers on a cruise are exempt from visa requirements (however, please check the conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to ensure their guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. They mostly lack windows and clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have unique offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and stay as long as possible.
In some places, they offer alcoholic beverages. Since intoxication impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone traveling at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the likelihood of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, so you cannot drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, a very large amount of snow can fall in a very short time, and you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility can be caused by falling or blowing snow, condensation on the window, or also ice that forms on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow are common, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest attraction for tourism in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to describe land travel with the purpose of sightseeing in the magnificent African wilderness, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and it's best to see them from a distance with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk or hiking safari, or simply a hike) is a multi-hour or multi-day trek.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the other being held in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may have found yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation terms vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation terms originating from the coronavirus do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It can be expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps dry damp clothes. Even when they aren't in the room, many hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the material is not too hot (this could cause it to shrink, and in extreme cases even burn).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for just one minute, while in others, it needs several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers can come into contact with animal pests that are not found in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Pure infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill people are usually not classified as pests.
Shopping in so-called duty-free zones allows you to purchase goods免除 from standard and consumption taxes.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the section with the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – typically 56-64 km/h – and their strict observance is more important than ever before.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service here is much stronger than on many other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria they are also quite varied and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastry with fruit is common. Apples are typically baked into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums usually appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. They are often combined with popular cakes and a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but satisfying pastry, try a filled doughnut, which is called either a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
We know curry "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Thanks to its 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
If this term is used without further qualification, it tends to mean food originating originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widely available throughout the archipelago, features many simply seasoned dishes. Among the prevalent seasonings favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can also pose a safety risk, as the rider's legs could potentially get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. A range of safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a relatively narrow, smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, are equipped with safety straps that allow the horn to come out of the saddle if the falling rider pulls it back.
The Cochamó Valley is a popular mountaineering destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America for its diverse, massive granite walls and cliffs.
The views from the mountain peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly discovering new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Popular downhill winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski fanatics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
With a backpack on skis: This activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It is related (but usually doesn't include them) to alpine ski touring and mountaineering, which is practiced in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski slope to be similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you were walking – but you will rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small world, but it contains many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly processing visa applications and undergoing passport checks.
In this regard, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as one country.
If you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each of the member states of the Schengen area separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which objects are made antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
Requirements vary around the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be classified as antiques despite being younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding represents an important means of livelihood for Sám, and the culture in the trade area is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi people were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale; they also made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily using reindeer as draft animals.
In today's world, many Sámi people are dedicating themselves to modern crafts. In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
Although the word "Gypsy" is very common, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advisories, this may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
Besides your own government, you might also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Informational reporting provides only a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views mentioned are often only superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social disruptions, or lead to loss of life.
Adverse weather and its various types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather, such as storms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are among the regionally and seasonally unfavorable weather phenomena.
We strongly advise travelers to consider all the risks that may arise as a result of adverse weather conditions in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should participate in specialized training.
Just search for "hostile environment training course" on the internet and you will probably find the address of some local company.
The course covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, along with practical experiences.
The course duration typically lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Passengers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey as well.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
Similarly diverse is the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents.
In the period after September 11, 2001, security checks at checkpoints also became much more tedious.
Transgender people should not expect to go through scanners without intrusion into their privacy and dignity before surgery.
Backwash is the returning swash from waves breaking on the beach, often near a cliff or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections where a rapid current and deep water can form.
Exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current is responsible for most drownings, which can be completely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try aiming for somewhere they won't catch you again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether anyone has registered you, you could try waiting for rescue.
The backlash hits faster than the cultural one (the initial idyllic phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be particularly challenging to readjust to their original culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People don't have to anticipate that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most fascinating things for children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the start of the show.
You usually always hear the bustle of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is like an open book of stories.
The sphinx is presented as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and host the most number of research bases, sixteen of which are still active as of 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area located on the southern part of the peninsula and is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here connect into a plateau and then emerge again, forming a 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel mountain range are located the highest mountains in Antarctica. It is the Vinson Massif with the highest peak, Mount Vinson, which reaches a height of 4892 m above sea level.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone. To make calls with it, you need to be outdoors in a location with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in shipping, including passenger ships, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year – a year off between school and further education – travel and learning remain the most popular choice.
It's particularly popular among recent graduates, as it offers them a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, participating in an international preparatory course can really increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually required to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for canoeing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and on its coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on the islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Canoeing is Finland's national sport, with one canoe for every seven or eight people.
It's the same for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is 1 to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea also offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you have a few full days to visit the historic town, while returning to the ship for the night.
If you are only going to the shore for a sightseeing excursion by tourist boat, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience, regardless of the age or background of the travelers. This is especially true if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversion to other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or on feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but problems arose on other routes and with smaller companies.
In case items were shipped by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take days on some transportation routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. However, airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to allocate a large amount of financial resources for this privilege (or ideally, to force your company to do so instead of you).
It won't be cheap, though: you can expect to pay approximately four times the usual fare for business class and up to eleven times the fare for first class!
Generally, it's not worth looking for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also very commonly used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the so-called Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna has transformed into a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, sprawling around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Amidst wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers, there are houses with traditional red-tiled roofs, a 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches. The city feels more like the atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than modern Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery, there are interesting marble dove statues above some of the graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk around an interesting village.

Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, it is possible to visit the significant shrine of the Virgin Mary of Fatima (the tomb), which is the site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please bear in mind that you are essentially a visitor to a mass grave and also a place of almost immeasurable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who spent a certain time of their lives there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or died of abuse, of Jewish as well as non-Jewish origin.
Access the site with maximum dignity, with all the seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the property by writing or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the residents prefer to communicate in Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and labels are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is currently commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only announced in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though it often relies on an imprecise stereotype, the best way to avoid getting lost in Paris is still to behave as well as possible and act like someone who is "well-bred" (with good manners). Getting lost will be significantly easier to avoid.
The stern exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely covered with forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, featuring a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It boasts an exceptionally wide range of plant communities thanks to its variety of microclimates, diverse soils, and differing altitudes.

You can also borrow this outfit from the storage room at the entrance, but please be aware that the clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Malorcan cuisine, like other cuisines in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and cannot do without olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, or other accompaniments like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and personal pronouns (Sie/Vy) are always capitalized, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important path that can be used to differentiate between verbs and objects.
It also demonstrably helps simplify reading, but writing is somewhat more complicated due to the need to distinguish whether a verb or an adjective is used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, because most words are pronounced the same way they are spelled.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Don't forget that 'r' and 'rr' are pronounced differently: 'caro' means dear and 'carro' is a carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar foundation could help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It's true that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish can quickly come to the conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough to not need to be studied separately.
Predmodern observatories are today usually obsolete and remain used as museums or educational facilities.
They are usually located in cities or on campuses because they were built in their heyday, when light pollution wasn't an issue. They are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized only for the emperor and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take even just one specimen.
If you visit a meticulously maintained garden and collect "samples," you will undoubtedly get thrown out.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and it's very easy to get around. Upon arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
However, if you find yourself in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (always) and also with strong sun (in clear skies, less frequently).
Several buses also travel north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for a vacation.
For example, a visit to the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, in their surroundings you will also find popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-believers and non-Christians around the world in Christian countries as well.
According to tradition, you will spend Easter night under the open sky to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it could calmly be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Traditional churches often hold Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations often taking place at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam here, flew here, or sailed here.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to undertake this journey. This led to the giant tortoise becoming a primarily browsing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced to the territory, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It will be a good opportunity to observe the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for the most part continuously.
And you will also be able to enjoy the stars, because light smog is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than that to which people in the West are accustomed.
Suits are common work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is key, with emphasis placed on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers must often obtain the approval of their superiors before making any decision, and it is expected that they will comply with their instructions without reservation.
