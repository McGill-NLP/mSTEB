USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the Olympic family's compelling need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the United States Olympic Committee's statement that it would be better for our athletes, teams, and their sports to proceed through internal, meaningful change within the organization rather than losing our status as a sports federation.

This confirms a theory that has already been widely held – that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – but it also provides information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored underneath.
Furthermore, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – such as barbs and plumules – researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The feathered structure suggests they were not used for flying but for thermoregulation or courtship displays. Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers suggested the sample originated from the plumage of an adult individual rather than a chick's down.
Even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers presented the sample as originating from the feather coat of an adult individual, not from the down of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at Gaziantep's main police station in Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty people.
The office of the regional governor announced that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police said they suspected that a fighter from Daesh (ISIS) was behind the attack.
They realized that the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all their systems was found to result from luminosity and rotation and orbital motion, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which relates to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less frequently a star experiences a polarity reversal.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect the effects of tides between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon's gravity affects the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way's gravity affect the dwarf elliptical galaxy of the Archer.
Researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it as a sort of halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting has not traditionally been high-tech: voters go into a booth and place a pre-printed paper strip in a ballot box, on which they have marked their desired candidate.
Once the authorities have verified the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
French election law has determined the course of events quite precisely.

Candidates can send representatives to testify to each part of the series of events. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision and following prescribed procedures.

Besides the Wednesday competition, Carpanedo participated in two other individual World Championship races.
The first of them was slalom, where his first run was interrupted. Also, 36 of the 116 participants did not manage to finish the race.
In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting class with an overall time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than first-place winner Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1:09.02 slower than Gyöngyi Dan of Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four cross-country skiers from the women's seated category were unable to finish their descent, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not place in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused have been named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
She was first taken to James Paget Hospital, located in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he/she was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son ever since.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be compromised because his image has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing images could prejudice a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be dangerously balancing acts if they publish alleged photos, etc."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for public prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that it will not comment on the matter further at this time, at least not before charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to run the way they did before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
According to information, other topics covered included the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands continued military presence in the valley for ten years following the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority will accept such a presence only for five years.
Forest rangers were instructed to closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplementary control trial for destructive animals, as the trial was being observed and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Volunteers meeting the requirements were recruited as a joint project between the national park and wildlife service and the Australian Sports shooters Federation NSW, and as part of the shooting federation's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the interim director responsible for the protection of NPWS parks and cultural heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's interim electoral board (CEP) meeting.
It is Marttely's fifth interim election committee in four years.
The delegation appointed by the President recommended last month the dismissal of the previous interim election council as part of a package of measures aimed at taking the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the government that began in October.
Rallies that occasionally escalated into violence originated from unrealized elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of an accident involving 27 devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 other overheating cases, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's request to postpone the investigation "very regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
The Emergency Management Agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reported damages in the territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no indications of a tsunami forming.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippines' capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took over for an elderly woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza died in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained to become an obstetrician and started working at Auckland産婦人科病院 (Auckland産婦人科Hospital) in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
Her research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, also known as flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on a blue moon night. A rather unique case, just like she herself was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted before the 2010 federal parliamentary elections. The number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
In the campaign leading up to the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the Australian Department of Transport asserted that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey shared their views and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the study, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was planning to participate in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness has been uncertain due to pain.
She hasn't been able to take the medication needed for pain relief because its use is prohibited in competitions.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of computer science and mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water and organic material to Earth, which could form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo's term as governor began earlier this year, and he signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jaw-slapping and ridiculous."
She is expected to run for president in 2016.
The United States aviation authority claims that NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older, ground-based techniques. This allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise positional information.
Additional transport will not be arranged, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and park-and-ride services are also not available at the match venue.
Concerns about a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published in Science magazine on Thursday reported the development of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species has evolved in just two generations, despite the series of events being thought to take much longer. The reason was the interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the invasive cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be fashioned into very small objects.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted illustrations in books called "book illustrations."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. The meter can be made at home using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (i.e., basic) the substance is.
The concentration of hydrogen ions (pH of H) in the tested chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of film.
In almost every house in the cities of Harappan and Mohenjo-daro there was a flush toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women bathed together in the same rooms.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite located in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space aboard a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A massive rocket, over 100 feet long, is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is making movement much easier and faster.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other vehicles.
Beneath them come the medium-sized cat-like animals, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are still many small feline animals (this also includes stray pet cats) that eat small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, of which the numbers are much larger.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological niche. According to this concept, each feline has its own special task, which is why it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, and they live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, as well as sometimes even thirty or more females and pups.
Females are typically closely related to each other, forming large families of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave largely in the same way as wolf or dog packs. These animals resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior surprisingly much, and they are also very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as strongly as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cat species can roar.
A tiger's roar doesn't resemble a lion's full-bodied roar, but rather a sentence composed of mumbled, shouted words.
Ocelots gladly eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are themselves.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find prey animals by sniffing the ground where they have walked, based on the scent of their food.
Ocelots have really good night vision thanks to their low-light vision, and they move very stealthily. They hunt by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (for example, if it migrates over a mountain range or a river, or to a new island, making it difficult to return), its environment is often different from what it used to be.
The resources of a new environment are different, and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, a new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it gradually starts to resemble the main population less and less over time.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations appear so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We make our house from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws sported over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and in addition to that, it had an extra row of teeth in its palate, so nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn't have stood a chance against it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual festive dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a nutty mouse.
As a second difference, the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, but the rich preferred to host joint feasts where they lounged on their sides while eating their meals.
Meals in ancient Rome could not feature foods that didn't arrive in Europe until later centuries, either from America or Asia.
They didn't have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not even a single ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strived to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and celebrations.
In each temple there was an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called holiest of holies, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers were built in temples, which were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was God's special sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women were cooking food outside, and the shops were just open sales tables along the streets. Stone was used as building material for the houses.
In Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, it was said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived on the island at that time.
Although every country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The writing is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up in the early days for storage.
So, it's likely that the marking was added just as a name tag.
D-Day, meaning the landings and the subsequent battles, had liberated Northern France, but the South was not yet free.
It was so-called Vichy France's territory, meaning the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were cooperating with the aggressors, not fighting against them at all.
The Allies attacked Southern France on August 15, 1944. The operation was codenamed Operation Dragoon.
The forces of the United States and the Free French liberated Southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word *civilis*, which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word *civis*, which means citizen or subject, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and it essentially also defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a long-lasting cultural footprint, and wide dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation – which consisted solely of a congress.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judicial system, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state authorities in the enforcement of all its regulations.
It also didn't have the power to change tax laws and inter-state tariffs.
Changing the articles required unanimous approval from all states, and the states were so dismissive of the central administration that often their representatives were not present.
The Italian national football team is, alongside the German national team, the second most successful in the world. It won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), so Japan is the world's seventh-largest island!
Because the Japanese islands are clustered together or in a group, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan began to be known as early as the 1400s, when European navigators passing by mentioned the island using the name Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
The Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan in 1624. It simultaneously initiated a change in the indigenous population's crop production methods and employed Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty's (1644–1912) military forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a prefecture of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
Having suffered defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: these are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the complex's perimeter have been restored so that tourists can get a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common size used in still photography worldwide is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced, but above all, the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited its aspect ratio.
Somewhat surprisingly, the 35 mm size is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and much-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism in an image while still maintaining some order.
According to that, the most effective spot in the main area is where the lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be scrutinized closely.
Christianity had united the states of Europe for over a thousand years, despite differences in languages and customs.
The power that reached everywhere affected everyone, both kings and commoners.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for precisely that purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to question the fulfillment of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the vital supplies of food and other essential items to the soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire sea areas, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Because the tactics only elicited limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
Nations decided, after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different periods: each stage of China or each ruling dynasty was its own dynasty.
Furthermore, there was an unstable period of regional division between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the right to sit in the highest seat of power in Xi'an's magnificent palace.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the idea of nationality, and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions also opened up to all male applicants. Thus, the most ambitious and successful ones were able to succeed.
The same applied to the army, as military ranks were now based on ability instead of social class.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave known as Hira, located on Mount Nur, which signifies light.
The cave itself, left in peace by the passage of time, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it is very difficult to find, even if you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Only a clear, beautiful sky is visible above, and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you see or hear very little of the earthly world.
Located on the Giza plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, the Giza necropolis contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller burial chambers, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 2nd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures that were built in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located on the Giza plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Kings (which includes the Great Pyramid as the largest), contains numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign of a rising bow looks like the letter V, and the sign of a falling bow is like a tack or a square missing its bottom line.
An ascending bow means you should start from the tip and pull the bow. A descending bow means you should start from the frog (the part you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising spring generally produces a softer sound, while a falling spring is stronger and more crisp.
You are welcome to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that printed articulation markings are for musical reasons in the score, so they should generally be followed.
A crowd composed of working-class women forced the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Elisabeth to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in carriages as a crowd surrounded them and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, someone in the crowd waved the head of the slain Swiss Guard in Versailles before the horrified queen.
Filipinos had to pay for the war costs incurred by American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration, which covered a significant portion of the costs, and to take care of the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of U.S. imperialism stemmed, of course, from the huge profits gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background against which the organization was founded.
The era of events is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the years 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, and after that came the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically encompasses a wide variety of ideas regarding the so-called driving force of technology, or the necessity of technology, in the sense of an absolute conception that human destiny is governed by a logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, there are two common core ideas: first, that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology has inherent, rather than socially conditioned, "effects" on societies.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of the car inevitably led to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars leads to more accidents in road traffic, which results in the invention of new healthcare methods to repair injured bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant element in Romanticism and was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals. Over time, customs and culture typical of this geographical location developed. Because these were in harmony with society, they functioned better than arbitrarily enacted laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal era, much like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as the center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its position weakened in the 12th century primarily because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valued than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at that moment that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the late 9th and 10th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing received strong influences from the Eastern Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication channels, however, the styles of Western Europe could have been 25–30 years behind.
Towards the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes, thanks to the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming where enough food is produced to feed only the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often based on organic methods, that utilizes native seeds for the eco-area combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by societal norms, and in this way they are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves based on age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
Characteristics that define an subculture as its own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, related to gender or sexuality, geographical, or a combination of several different factors.
Often, members of subcultures communicate their affiliation through the stylistic use of distinctive and symbolic elements, including fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods for demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example those few unfortunate children who, growing up, were deprived of the socialization offered by adults due to neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Children like this are called "wild". Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment has resulted from parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Runaway children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some say others are bred by animals, while others claim they lived wild in nature.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than a human, they behave (within the limits of their physical constraints) almost exactly the same way as their caregiver animal, for example, showing similar fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more engaging. Timely support for learning (scaffolding) goes a step further.
Ladders are not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, for example, when using new computer software or starting a new project.
Ladders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stairs are built into the software, and their purpose is to pose questions, give prompts, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's help.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not caring, supportive, and nurturing, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of foster care is to meet all of their basic needs that were lacking in their previous homes.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet imply additional dimensions in the case of use-intention theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences on internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new perspectives on impact when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It has been claimed, in particular, that it is possible to identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
She even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: cryptic and显性 (phenotypic). **Note:** I've included "phenotypic" as a translation of "ilmenevä" as it is the most accurate and commonly used term in genetics. "显性" literally means "manifest" but in this context, "phenotypic" is a more precise and standard translation.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Specialization and recombination shift variation back and forth between these two reservoirs with each generation.
Primates, which have a similar digestive system to humans, have difficulty obtaining enough amino acids from the plants available on savanns.
Furthermore, staying without them has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available growth resources would have been proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them without cooking.
Instead, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible, and in addition, they provide ample amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we have no reason to be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similarly way to how savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption means intentionally waking up during a normal sleep cycle and falling back asleep a little later (10–60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that gently brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you notice yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, forcing you to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive his life force is. Everyone can find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it incorporated the concept of Mahayana, or the Great Vehicle, as well as many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing loving-kindness.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing deities purifies energy channels, activates chakras, and develops consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war ended, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, which led to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was truly fought, as proxy armies battled on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense had already collapsed by September 17, 1939, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were quickly rendered worthless in almost one night, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced into the country and established the White Sea–Baltic and Southwestern Belorussian fronts after attacking the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact, and various bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that one's own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mainly tried to prevent this traffic with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Sheep were apparently domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to easily get milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Tame goats were typically raised in herds that roamed hilly terrain or other pastures. Often, they were tended by goat herders, who were frequently children or young people, just like the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still in use today.
Tramways were built in England as early as the 1500s.
Although the wagon tracks consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, thanks to them, horses were able to pull wagons faster and with heavier loads than on the slightly uneven roads of the time.
Sleepers were put into use quite early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more effective if there were an iron strip on top of them.
The practice became common, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the carriages more.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were put into use.
The first known mode of transport was walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (upright man) evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it did not walk upright as consistently.
Bipedalism has been found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering somewhat.
This is often just like treating the symptoms of an illness, but if we don't want only a temporary solution, we should find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have grown due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After the Congress approved it on July 4th, the handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, 150–200 copies were printed, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon read the document aloud for the first time publicly in Independence Hall's courtyard on July 8th.
One of them was sent on July 6th to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap open archives, now recognized as such, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's a lot of all sorts of things in birds that still look like monstrous lizards.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two back legs like tyrannosaurs.
In practice, all currently used computers are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
In a binary number, there can only be one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers – or in computer circuit terminology, bits.
Internal poisoning isn't necessarily immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a diagnosis can't be made right away.
The clearest sign of internal poisoning is a visible, opened medicine container or a container containing poisonous household chemicals.
See the first aid instructions regarding this poison on the label.
Entomologists use the term "lice" to specifically refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the fact that lice were once very common. Lice are insects that are very well adapted as parasites of humans.
Fleas and ticks are both nest-dwelling, adapted to living in the nest or cocoon of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the tendency to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can, if they wish, create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main task of science is to determine how the world works using scientific methods. The scientific method guides most of scientific research.
However, it's not just about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
When the proficiency in the Greek language weakened in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend significantly on the existence of innate cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue their free-running cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells can be inherited by children, and mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites with the intention of enjoying the scenery – as well as wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in a travel destination include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and learning about the ecosystem.
As one example, one could mention visiting the orangutans of Borneo, learning from them, and photographing them.
Every morning, the residents of small rural towns drive to work, and they encounter others whose workplace is where they themselves originated.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to the private car-based transportation system and simultaneously supports it.
Science is now providing indications that the massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it a more fundamental issue?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their mutual interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave relatively consistently. Therefore, traffic flows generally have a reasonably good consistency and can be presented roughly mathematically.
In order to better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in the standardization, planning, and maintenance of road networks.
Insects were among the first animals to take flight. Flight helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward against their body.
This way, they have access to a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Damselflies and dragonflies are currently the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a certain man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought she was right, but many believed the opposite – that the entire solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the world's second longest and largest river. It has over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching up to 6 miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the planet's freshwater that flows into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The actual length of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or building skill of the pyramids of Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of the Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the world's smallest country by population.
The Vatican City State uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people working in the country also speak Italian in their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because all of them occur in nature on their own and because they are also relatively easy to mine with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a combination of one or more basic elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It reminded more of the four states of matter – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, in that order – but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. There are also, of course, metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit within this sentence's final period.
Indeed, the pencil was a good friend to many when it was introduced to the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the value and uses of the pencil have become more scorned.
Nowadays, messages are written on computer screens, and you never need to reach for a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard next when something newer comes onto the scene.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus made up of many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the core releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which makes them prone to decay from even slight or no disturbance.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The Moon's outermost layer is called its crust.
The thickness of the Moon's crust is approximately 70 kilometers on the near side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner underwater and thicker on plateaus.
Darker marine areas may be more visible on the upwelling side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories primarily focus on investigating what lies behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they mature.
These theories examine why some people want what they want, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start leading their former peers, generally speaking, two different behavioral patterns can emerge. At one end of the scale is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "the dirty ones").
A leader like this has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, distributing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the group has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the group's successes and failures.
This kind of behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with some subtle differences.
Virtual team members act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the required standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process required for establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across all operational departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
As a result, a process in which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes a continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The increasing number of new technologies provides the opportunity to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This way we get a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
In artificial intelligence research, the goal is to enable machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include monitoring, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become specialized fields that focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, just as it naturally integrates into various software applications in home computers and video games.
School trips are an important part of education. Often, teachers would like to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution, namely virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at their desks.
Sharing a class trip virtually is an excellent way to reminisce about it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina plan a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated annually, but older versions are preserved online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of their blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to put effort into improving their writing and avoiding criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to better grasp the world around them". The need to fuel the readership's interest motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can give students the opportunity to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to materials on the internet, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and express their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital city, with a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canadian history and culture.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls, and to the north is, for example, the pristine, beautiful Muskoka.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders consider the quintessential Canadian province.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The next demographic comparison surprises many: In the United States, there are more African Americans than there are citizens of Canada in total.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of them and, in terms of its nature, like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and they are known as luxurious beach destinations.
Arabs also brought Islam with them to the countries, and it gained a strong foothold in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women – All female travelers are advised, regardless of their actual marital status, to say that they are married.
Wearing the ring helps too (as long as it doesn't look too valuable).
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause things that they might experience as harassment. It is not uncommon for someone to follow after, grab a wrist, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify advances!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 9th century BC by Berber fishermen, and both Phoenicians, Romans, and Vandals used it as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tagines, pottery, leather goods, and water pipes, as well as a wide array of trinkets, in the old medina, but everything is intended for tourists.
Goma is a city in eastern the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Rubber is reasonably safe, but all excursions outside the city require reconnaissance in the province of North Pain to assess the current state of ongoing battles.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo. You can also find some of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trackers there.
For getting around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A regular (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
When combined with its rather difficult location, "Timbuktu" has begun to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger in 1990 due to the threat posed by the sand formed by the desert.
It was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different natural areas, each supporting different wildlife and plants.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
A daily conservation and entrance fee is charged in the park, as in all South African national parks.
It might be useful to also buy a Wild Card, which gives you access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong Area its name, and it is a main destination for many tourists.
The procession of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparkling columnar diagram, which is best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best aspects of Hong Kong are seen by leaving the island and heading towards the port area of Kowloon, which is located opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban area is located on reclaimed land, densely built up on the northern shore.
The British colonial masters claimed this place for themselves, and if you look for signs of the region's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest area. It extends 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian side is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also include some of the last remnants of those magnificent savannas that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is covered by water or wetland areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer there.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east, to Jakari and Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because local buses in the area are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most municipalities, small Japanese Coaster buses run, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Carpool taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The underpass clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work ended in August 2011, but the bridge wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the border stations in Brazil are estimated to be completed.
The Guaranis were the most significant of the indigenous groups inhabiting the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, but also practiced subsistence farming.
In the Chaco region lived other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was previously called the "Giant Province of Indians," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the country's indigenous peoples in the 16th century.
The Spanish started the colonial era, which lasted three hundred years.
Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen during other times of the year.
News about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the island's only bank, which is located at Stanley's, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted at Stanley's as well.
Credit cards likely won't be accepted in remote islands, although currencies of Great Britain and the United States may be acceptable. Clarify the accepted payment method by asking the owners in advance.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even if they may appear quite docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them space.
Also, please keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strongly scented food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a notorious naval standoff occurred in the harbor, in which seven ships – German, American, and British – refused to leave port.
All the ships sank, with the exception of one British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost in the process.
The peaceful gathering held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement led to the assassination of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches there because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific coast and extend from north Long Bay to south Devonport.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and the pine trees provide shade on most of them.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland, within the Waitematā Harbour.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the coastline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may hold up better during travel.
Tap water is completely safe to drink locally, but the cautious ones will easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white-style milk coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of frothed milk. Tea is served without milk.
Cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are organized to Riutta throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these trips are rare on Riutta.
So heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found north of the 1770 line near beaches and river estuaries from October to April. They can occasionally be encountered at other times as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will likely swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A traveler gets peace of mind when booking in advance, knowing that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have deals for specific hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation valid if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests should first be directed through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the grounds, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music performances end, there may be venues at the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as passing through the ice can create a very terrible noise in the worst parts.
The Helsinki cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood – and within the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Everyone who plans to drive at high latitudes or in mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive in the same way as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that a car can get stuck.
Snowfall or snow blowing in the wind, as well as moisture or ice accumulated on vehicle windows, may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually operates year-round without disruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest draw and a highlight for many visitors.
In a general sense, the word "safari" refers to traveling by land with the purpose of observing Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is sufficient for watching them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as bushwalking, hiking safari, and trekking) refers to a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, as it served as the host for the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost 2,500–130,000 yen, with tickets typically costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, it's possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they aren't in the room itself.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't particularly care about ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for one minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have any doubts, it's worth considering buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Tourists may encounter animals that are destructive and unfamiliar to them from their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in a worse case, allergic reactions, spread toxins, and transmit diseases.
Genuine infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people violently are generally not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means the opportunity to purchase goods in certain places that are exempt from excise duty and sales tax.
Tourists traveling to countries with high taxes may sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike because it repeatedly traverses remote woodland.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: you'll encounter many steep inclines and declines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The specified speed limits are significantly lower than on earlier and later sections – generally 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, reminiscent of pastries from neighboring Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you crave small but substantial pastries, try one called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In Southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is typically used.
Because there are 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional food cultures throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further definition, it generally refers to food originating from central and eastern Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, and it features a large selection of simply seasoned dishes. Flavors favored by Javanese people include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
The rider gains more stability from them, but they can pose safety concerns because the rider's legs might get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but their leg gets caught in the stirrup, the escaping horse may turn around and drag them behind. Various precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with heels, featuring a smooth and rather narrow sole.
In some saddles, especially English saddles, there is a safety strap that allows the stirrup strap to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backward.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley features various large granite walls and cliffs.
From the peaks, there are breathtaking views. Climbers arriving from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing and snowboarding, which are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet, are popular sports.
Skiing is an important tourism activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bunnies," plan entire holidays centered around skiing in a specific destination.
Cross-country skiing is a very old idea – cave paintings depicting skiers have been made as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 1600s, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first leisure ski resort in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski hiking, or ski touring.
It is related to alpine skiing-style hiking or mountaineering, but it doesn't usually include that, because the latter is practiced in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you rarely get to the same speed as when skiing on groomed trails and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and going through passport checks multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single state in this regard.
As long as you stay within this area, you can usually cross the border without being subject to passport control again.
Once you have a Schengen visa, you also don't need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving you time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define all items older than one hundred years as antiques.
The definition varies depending on the geographical location. For example, in North America, newer objects are considered antiques than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture associated with it is also important to many people in other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi people have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar livelihoods, keeping reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Saami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If a travel advisory concerns your destination country, it may affect your travel health insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps it's worth asking for advice from other states in addition to your own, even though their advice is intended for their own citizens.
As one example, Americans may find themselves in different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The briefings are just short summaries of a country's political situation.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial, generalized, and too simplified compared to more detailed information obtained elsewhere.
Dangerous weather is a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that can depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, whirlwinds, flash floods, and cyclones.
Blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms are among the regional and seasonal phenomena associated with hazardous weather.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of weather conditions at the destination, as this may affect travel plans.
Everyone who wishes to visit a country interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
A web search for "Hostile environment course" will likely return the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here in much greater detail and typically combined with practical experience.
The course typically lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender confirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or to update documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who haven't had surgery shouldn't assume they'll get through security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the shore. They are often found on reefs or similar places.
Due to underwater formations, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current can form in the deep water there.
Most deaths are a result of exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, it might be wise to wait for rescuers.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock (the adjustment phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Tourists who easily adapt to a new culture can sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People don't necessarily realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the start of the presentation, they can be seen in complete silence.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of light and sound is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and storyteller of a long tale.
Scenes are presented against pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases there. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the crater of a still-active volcano, filled with water, forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea on the south side of the peninsula.
The Niemi Hills blend there into the plain and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which the Minnesota Glacier divides in half.
In the northern part, located in the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, namely the Vinson Massif, the highest peak of which is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones, as you usually have to be outdoors and maintain a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, as well as on pleasure boats. Similarly, it is used by expeditions that require remote data and voice connections.
Your local phone service provider can likely provide more information about connecting to that service.
Travel and learning are increasingly popular options among those planning to take a gap year.
It's particularly popular among students graduating from school because they can have a gap year before university without their education being negatively impacted.
In many cases, participating in a gap year course abroad can even improve the chances of continuing higher education in one's home country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participating in these training programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagoes.
In the archipelagoes and on the lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat the size of a bite.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any boats, you get a different experience from smaller boats or even a kayak.
Boating is a popular leisure activity in Finland, where there are boats for every seventh or eighth person.
The situation is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in St. Petersburg.
This means you can visit a historical city for a few days and still return to the ship for the night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you only visit the countries on excursions organized by a cruise ship (as of 2009).
Berlin, Germany, is included in the brochures for some cruises. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced something traumatic.
There's no reason to be ashamed of it: it's no different from the fears and dislikes many other people have for certain things.
For some people, a certain understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during the flight may help overcome fear stemming from ignorance or a feeling of helplessness.
Transportation companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, speed is very important for companies' documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own airplanes on some routes, but there was a problem on other routes and with smaller companies.
If they shipped goods by air freight, then on some routes, unloading and customs clearance of the cargo could take days.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send them as registered baggage. Airlines' regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so this is where we need you.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a huge stack of money for this privilege (or perhaps better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it won't be cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of economy class for business class, and eleven times the price of first class!
Generally speaking, it's not worth even looking for discounts on business class or first-class tickets for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know that there is a specific core group of travelers willing to pay a fortune to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in Transnistria, Moldova, in 1994. It has its own administration and currency, but no UN member state recognizes it.
Economic ties have re-emerged between these two parts of Moldova, even though political negotiations have failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third-largest city. Its population is around 3.7 million inhabitants, it is the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling center of trade, surrounded by mountains and sprawling around a vast bay.
Amidst wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers lie traditional red-brick roofs, a 1700s square, and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere resembles Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
In Haldarsvík there is an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
There are interesting dove sculptures on top of some of the tombstones in the churchyard.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling around the fascinating village.
North of here and easily accessible lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. Foreigners came to know it through the laudatory account written by Lord Byron, in which he described its splendor.
ScottUrbin bus line 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern direction, it's worth visiting the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is world-renowned for the Apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a site of immense significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Even now, many men and women who survived after being there still live, and many others whose loved ones were murdered there or forced to work themselves to death there, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Remember to treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by drawing or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan because it is the first official language by law.
Still, Spanish is also commonly used in public transport and other services.
The usual announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system announces unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though it's often just an unfounded stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to be as decent as possible and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It makes getting around much easier.
The Parisians' rude exterior quickly melts away if you show ordinary politeness.
Plitvice National Park has a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and pine, and its vegetation is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a notably wide variety of plant communities there, due to diverse microclimates, varying soil, and elevation differences.
The area is also home to an incredibly diverse range of animal and bird species.
Besides more common species, you can encounter rare wildlife there, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and grouse.
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you might get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to wear trousers that extend below the knee.
They can also borrow from the entrance's clothing selection, but they aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine is based, like other Mediterranean cuisines, on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple, popular summer dinner is pa amb oli, which consists of bread with olive oil and tomato, and any available accompaniment, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and also the word "Sie" meaning "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G should be given the most attention, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Remember also to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently. 'Caro' means beloved, 'carro' means wagons.
Persian grammar is quite easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you learn many things about Persian grammar and improve your understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those who know a little Spanish might suddenly imagine that Portuguese is so close that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, old-fashioned observatories are generally no longer used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Because light pollution wasn't such a problem in their day, they are usually located in cities or campuses, and they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities, and they are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 7th century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom festival only for himself and members of the aristocratic court who influenced the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" sample.
If you visit a formal and well-maintained garden, you'll be kicked out for collecting "samples" without any hesitation.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it's very easy to find your way around. You can buy almost anything after arriving.
But when you are in the heart of the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which happens rarely).
In addition, a few buses run north to Hebron, to the burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, according to tradition.
Make sure the bus you plan to get on also goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to plan a vacation around.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated on the day of Jesus' birth.
Even in non-Christian countries and among non-Christians around the world, many traditions associated with the celebration have been adopted.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a spring and fertility ritual predating Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold Easter midnight mass on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. The congregation often begins celebrating at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the island arrived there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, the mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main herbivore of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky is dark almost around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are the typical work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Group work is emphasized over individual achievements.
Employees often need their supervisor's approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their supervisor's instructions without hesitation.
