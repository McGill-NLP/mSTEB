This thing doesn't confirm, but that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, and it's a widely accepted theory. However, it also provides details that fossils generally can't offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scholars say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotene-colored on the underside.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed skeletal chain, called the "vertebral column," but they possess other characteristics of feathers – such as barbs and down – and researchers concluded that the vertebral column was most likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests they aren't used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that despite this specimen belonging to a small dinosaur, the sample shows a significant amount of feathers, not just at the tail.
Researchers indicated that despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult bird, not chicken feathers.

Two compounds interact with each other to form crystals that may impair kidney function, according to researchers at the university.
Researchers observed crystals forming in cat urine when melamine and cyanuric acid were added.
The composition of these crystals is identical to the composition found in the urine of affected pets when compared using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
I don't know if you understand the topic or not, but most goods coming from Central America enter this country without taxes.
Despite that, taxes are imposed on eighty percent of our exports of goods through customs tariffs in Central American countries, just as we treat you.
That didn't seem logical to me; it certainly wasn't fair.
What I want to say to the people is that you treat us as we treat you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The draft law stipulates the placement of a sticker marked "18" on violent video games sold in the state of California, and a fine of up to $1000 per offense will be imposed for selling them to minors.
The Director of Public Prosecution, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of both Honee and Price.
He resigned them, and his replacement in the Council of Ministers was member of parliament, Aid Dify. It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will take the job of Minister of Commerce, which Dify is leaving.
They and Bryce have a scheduled appearance at Westminster Judges Court on February 16th.
Among the losses was Nicolas Aldin, 25 years old, and Zakary Koudibac, 21 years old. Koudibac was the driver.
Edgar Figueroa sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
Schneider is suffering from persistent pain, blindness in one eye, and the loss of a part of his skull; his face was rebuilt with lithium. All of this occurred while the "Okha" weapon failed after being aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a US Air Force base in his country.
After the Thursday event, Karbanido competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the winding roller derby race, where she achieved the result of "didn't finish the race" in her first round. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
Her second race – the giant slalom ski race – saw her finish in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Claudia Luchs of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher, Gjonji Dani of Hungary.
Four para-skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their heats, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to achieve a ranking in the race.
The police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
And the Deputy General Inspector, Di. K. Arya, said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her telephone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Botha Kanga, Rambro Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the defendants were brought before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, not a single one of them was injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
They have closed the road where the collision occurred, temporarily, and at the same time, emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT car.
They had initially taken him to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Edinburgh Park Hospital in Cambridge.
From that time, Adikuya became accused in the Sheriff's Court of Edinburgh of murdering her son.
She is being held under detention, and they are waiting for the indictment and trial, but any evidence from a witness may be suspect because her picture has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other places in Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts have considered that publishing images can be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading down a dangerous path because they have published photos or something similar of the suspects."
The office of the official in charge of claims told journalists that there would be no further comments until at least an indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, will reportedly refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The second topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples and a problem and the depth of Jordan.
Israel continues to demand a military presence in the Golan Heights for ten years, upon signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence for five years.
The guards were supposed to closely supervise the released ones in the supplementary pest control experiment, because the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the "National Gardens and Wildlife Authority" and the "Australian الرياضيين Hunters Association," qualified volunteers selected within the association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, the acting director of the National Park and Wildlife Service (NPWS) responsible for heritage preservation, the four fishermen selected for the first fishing operation received safety guidelines and comprehensive training.
Martili took the oath of office yesterday in a new temporary electoral council consisting of nine members.
It is Martelli's fifth interim electoral council within four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was like Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted due to the failure to hold the elections that were supposed to take place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in "iPod" devices have been reported, which resulted in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional cases of burnout, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded to Able's request to postpone the report, saying "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 9:19 PM GMT).
The Emergency Management Office in Northern Mariana announced that they haven't received any reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indications of a tsunami occurring.
A Filipino police officer paralyzed tourists from Hong Kong by taking their bus hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired bullets from his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, in addition to the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an old, elderly woman because she needed the square for the pigeons. And Mendoza was shot.
He followed in his father's footsteps and pursued medicine as a profession.
He trained as a doctor of women and childbirth, and then began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
"Leggins" started investigating premature births during his free time, and during his work at the hospital.
His research has shown that administering a hormone accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved the flight recorders, also known as the "black box," on Thursday.
Also, the fellow fighters praised Luna.
Tumi Dremer said, "Luna was the first extremist queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, there isn't anyone like her."
Colson "Goldstein" Ranلز said, "Luna was eccentric like me... and possibly more so than me... I loved her and I miss her... I wish she were in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people included in the survey before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the federal election campaign in 2010 that she believed Australia must become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those included in the survey agree with this viewpoint and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
Regarding the opposing ends of the survey, 29% of those included in the survey believe Australia should return to a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The fitness of the gold medalist in the Olympic physical games has come under doubt due to his discontent, as he was supposed to swim 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because using these medications is prohibited during games.
Curt Cates Cooper, a mathematics expert and computer science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various devices and programs at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source of delivering water to Earth, as well as organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
The scholars wish they understood how planets form, especially how Earth formed from the impact of comets with Earth from a long time ago.
Komo, 53 years old, started his rule early this year, and a bill legalizing same-sex marriage passed last month.
He said about the rumors that they were "political chatter and nonsense."
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says allows pilots to fly on shorter routes, which will save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses a technology linked to satellites, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar to allow air observers to pinpoint the location of an aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation options, and the ground trains don't stop at Wembley, in addition to the lack of parking spaces, parking facilities, and roadside pick-up.
It raised fears of a lack of transportation, leading to the possibility of needing to hold the match behind closed doors, without the presence of the fans, in favor of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported on the emergence of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the development of new species took two generations, despite it being thought that this process would take much longer – due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the sharp-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be wound and coiled. It can be hammered or rolled into the shape of paper.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
They ask him for the atomic number of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this number using pomegranate juice.
The color of the Kobs fruit juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
They measure the level of acidity by counting the number of hydrogen ions (the H symbol in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons, not electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, and this will make you feel a strange sensation and form a kind of coating.
My city, Hadaba and Mohenjo Daro, had toilets with a flushing mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sanitation systems were discovered in houses in the cities of Minos in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets there in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then reflects it almost at the same time.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to place a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in an amazing way; but what remains most important is the availability of an easier and faster means of transportation that it contributed to us.
The train, cars, and many other modes of transportation have traversed for us.
Below them, there are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small predators (including stray domestic cats) eating the most abundant small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called herds.
The Asad family consists of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
Usually, females are closer to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs. What's surprising is that the animals are similar to lions (but not the other big mammals) in their behavior and very deadly to their prey.
As a comprehensive athlete, the tiger excels at climbing (even if not perfectly) as well as swimming and jumping long distances and pulling with strength five times that of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the cat family) as lions, leopards, and cheetahs. These four are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of the lion, full volume, but it is closer to a shout with angry words.
The dwarf leopard loves to eat small animals; it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the dwarf leopard hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scholars believe that the cats of Al-Aslout track and find animals that eat them (prey) by using their sense of smell; they smell where they were on the ground.
You can see well in the darkness using night vision, and its path also moves. It hunts dwarf tigers by camouflaging with its surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small number of the population) is separated from the main population they belong to (for example, if they migrate across a mountain range or river, or migrate to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
Given that this new environment contains diverse resources and competitors, the new group will need different attributes or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to the strength it required initially.
There hasn't been any change whatsoever to the indigenous population; they still need the same adaptation methods as we've always known them.
As time passes and new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarities with other residents gradually diminish.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that we can't even call them the same type.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered a deterministic outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (i.e., exhalation).
Plants make use of the sun for their sustenance through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We repair our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals can't live.
The Mawsasour was the dominant predator in his time, so he wasn't afraid of anything except other Mawsasours.
The long canines were encrusted with over 70 teeth, resembling blades, in addition to a second set in the roof of her mouth, which means there's no escape for anything that stands in her way.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps he had a forked tongue. His diet contained turtles, large fish, and the second Mosasaurus, and he may have been a carnivore.
She even attacked anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex can compare to her.
While most of their food, chicken, is well-known to us, the Romans have their share of unusual or uncommon Eid elements, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the Zaghabah.
There was a second difference, which is that while the poor and women were eating their food while sitting on the benches, the rich men liked to hold feasts together, reclining on their sides while performing their duties.
It was not possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have any corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, nor did any of the ancient Romans taste turkey.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the deities, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the deities during celebrations and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a safe hermitage, which only the priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes unique towers shaped like pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses didn't hold much importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open tables overlooking the street. Stones were used in building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Humans inhabited Greenland scatteredly. It is said in the Scandinavian sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there before.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite each country being "Scandinavian."
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Independence Declaration.
But that's not correct. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The phrase "Declaration of Independence Original, dated July 4, 1776" is written on the back of the independence announcement. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The landings on the fateful day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remained an enemy and was not liberated.
He ruled Vichy France. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France, and they were on their way towards Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "citizen," and relates to "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city or state of the city." This also defines a social group in a certain way.
Self-sufficient cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implicitly means transmitting knowledge across generations, leaving a cultural imprint, and distributing knowledge fairly.
Often, lesser cultures fade away without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress being the only element within it—under the Basic Law of the Federal Union.
The Congress lacked any authority to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
In addition to that, you do not have the authority to exceed the laws and tariffs imposed between the states.
The materials required unanimous approval from all governorates before being amended, and the governorates mocked the central government to the point that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, shuttlecock, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, luge, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, they often refer to Japan - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its journey back in the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed there recorded the island's name as Lha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing the original grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) armies controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province belonging to the Qing Empire in 1885.
In the year 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu city consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography around the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production has remained a persistent enemy up to the present day, but more importantly than that is that the shape of image sensors in digital cameras has inherited the aspect ratio.
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The dimensions of this image are (when divided by 12 to get the ratio in its simplest whole number form) therefore they will be 3:2.
The aspect ratio, which is a common characteristic of many of the advanced image system formats (for example), is equal to or close to it.
The principle of the threefold division that is often misused and mocked, forms a simple guiding principle that works to create dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear manner.
It is said that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity bound the European countries together for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power that was possessed affected everyone, from the king down to the subjects.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money exists specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the Church in Rome lasted for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question the extent of faithfulness to the requirements of doctrine.
Quickly, Britain responded by blockading Germany from the sea after the skirmishes began.
The strategy has proven effective; cutting off military and civilian vital supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law and which is documented and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has fouled international waters in order to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, a move that threatens even ships that have nothing to do with the war.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar retaliation to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In the year 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison's company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batie (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of presenting different time periods; each era of China or each dynasty in power was of a different kind.
In addition to that, there was between each ruling dynasty a period of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
A fierce war broke out during these periods between many nobles vying for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in battles to sit on the highest seats in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects there, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to the ruler alone.
Furthermore, after the revolution, professions were open to all applicants, which allowed the more ambitious and successful individuals to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because instead of the army's classifications being based on class, they now rely on weaponry.
The French Revolution also inspired many members of the oppressed working class and other people in other countries to ignite their revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad was strongly concerned with matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Al-Noor."
The cave itself presents, what remains from throughout the ages, a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it's not easy to find him at all, even if you know his location. Once you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
You can't see anything but the beautiful, clear sky above the many mountains surrounding it. It's not possible to see or hear much of this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is considered the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era. The Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built to bury the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or the "Giza necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The shape of the "acute accent" pointing upwards is like the letter "V," and the shape of the "grave accent" pointing downwards is like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
A higher sign indicates that you must start from the end and push the arc, while a lower sign means that you must start from the end of the arc (where you hold the arc with your hand) and pull it.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more taut.
Don't hesitate to draw your own marks with the pencil, and just remember that the printed curved marks exist for musical reasons, so you usually have to respect them.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie-Thérèse who was 11 years old and Louis Charles who was four years old), as well as the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled returning to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A group of people managed to force the King and Queen to open their car windows wide open.
A member of the gang, at a time when he was waving the head of one of the slain royal guards in Versailles, appeared before the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people bore the expenses of the war of imperialist the United States of America by its invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through bank houses and Wall Street.
Of course, the large profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the organization, so that we understand the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events occurred was known as the Upper Middle Ages, which is the period in European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, which collectively ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive of technology or technological necessity to a strict feeling that the destiny of humankind is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general shared ideas in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself proceeds along a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on deeply rooted societies, rather than being tied to the society.
For example, one might say that the car engine needs to be accompanied by road development.
However, building a road network along the country doesn't have an economic benefit if there are few cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to an increase in road accident rates, which leads to the innovation of new technologies in healthcare to treat affected people.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism with roots in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose. These, being in harmony with the community's place, were better than laws imposed by force.
Just as Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being the center of luxury; it began in the year 400 AD and continued until the year 1100 AD.
Her condition declined primarily during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusades returned, bringing with them goods like silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital was bestowed upon Paris instead of Constantinople.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture had a strong influence on clothing in the East.
Despite that, due to the slow communication channels, the patterns in the West may be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, a result of the Crusades, was the beginning of people using rice to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farming where they plant to produce just enough food for the farmer and his family's needs only.
Subsistence farming – which is often done without fertilizers or pesticides – is considered a simple system that uses stored seeds that are suitable for the region's ecosystem, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, with the aim of increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still prevalent in many developing countries.
Subcultures facilitate connection between individuals with similar thought patterns and those who feel marginalized by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
Perhaps the characteristics that define the distinctiveness of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures assert their belonging through the use of various and symbolic styles that include clothing, affectation, and custom.
One of the most common ways used to highlight the importance of socialization is by relying on the few unfortunate cases of children who suffered due to neglect, bad luck, or intentional harm, and who were not socially connected by adults during their upbringing.
They call these children "the wild ones" or "the feral ones." Some homeless children have been detained by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child was abandoned due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the stray children were subjected to abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
And others say that they were raised by animals; and it is said that some lived in the wilderness alone.
Anything raised by animals, not humans, will exhibit wild child-like behavior (within physical limits) that closely resembles the behaviors of a specially cared-for animal, such as fear of humans or disregarding them.
While project-based learning is intended to make the learning process easier and more engaging, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn't a way of learning, but it is truly a helpful tool that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or on-site, and secondly, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as well as a clip art figure in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported within the program and aims to pose questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that students might find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed within a nurturing care framework for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn't focus on nurturing, care, and education, but they do.
We understand that the alternative care system is considered a safe zone for these ignorant people.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they came from before.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and methods of fulfillment.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James and others, 1995).
"Personal participation" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Aimi and McCord (1998) in their study of public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements lasting for a fraction of a second.
It is particularly claimed that one can discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, pointed out that the president's speech implies that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess truthfulness with accuracy.
Indeed, he proposes the idea that these capabilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a hidden group and a visible one.
The boom introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive differences.
It works by separating and reassembling to make the difference random and wandering, and reviewed between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for ruminants that have a digestive system similar to humans to obtain the amino acids they need from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failing to do so will lead to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The readily available plant resources were mainly proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for animals like us to digest if not cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide proteins in high quantities and contain all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees solve it in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can easily do this using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly adjusting the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
If tension decreases, the positivity it grants increases, which is the strength of life. Every person has the potential to find peace and complete contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Hindu Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
The energy of "Kundalini" (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan meditation center is God Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, they cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and create enlightenment consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led the Soviet Union and the United States of America to cooperate. However, with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have become enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
It was supposed that this war would continue for the next forty years, and that the fighting would be on the ground, via proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed completely, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
Nevertheless, these plans quickly became obsolete overnight, as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts for the Soviet Union after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga for Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Agreement, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition dictates that the role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously obstructing the ability of your enemy to transport their people and goods.
One of the modern examples worth noting is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion, and its weapon of choice was the use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to invade Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began preserving it because access to milk, hair, meat, and hides was easy.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or secondary grazing areas, and they were often herded by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, in the same way as the well-known shepherd widely. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
The roads for carriages were established in England dating back to the 16th century.
Despite the old railway carriages being made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads compared to the roads which were considered more rugged at that time.
They invented train tracks a little early to stabilize the routes, but it later became clear that placing an iron strip above the track makes it more effective.
This has become a customary practice, but the iron of the wheel axles of the carts wears out more.
Finally, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk in a consistently upright manner.
Fossil fragments with two feet were discovered in Australopithecus excavations dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, despite Sahelanthropus potentially having walked upright seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering a little.
This is exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we must identify the root cause of the problems and resolve them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed greatly due to scientific advancement and technology for humanity, and problems have become greater due to population increase and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, they sent a handwritten draft to John Dunlap's printing house, where it was copied onto some buildings by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson.
At night, they copied between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Monetary Bulletins."
The first public reading of the document by John Nixon was in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
They sent one of them to George Washington on July 6th, and the troops in New York read it in his name on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The folded pages of Dunlab represent the oldest remaining copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is not currently available.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't realize they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things around birds whose shape resembles dinosaurs.
It has feet, and it has external protective layers and claws, and it lays eggs, and it walks on its hind legs like a lithe dinosaur.
All computers used today rely virtually on processing encrypted information as binary numbers.
The value of a binary digit can be either one of two values, namely 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits – if we use the conventional computer language.
Internal poisoning may not manifest its symptoms directly; a quick diagnosis cannot be built upon the appearance of symptoms like nausea and vomiting, which are generally not sufficient.
A good indicator of internal poisoning may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Read the poster so that you can learn about the first aid guidelines specific to the particular poison.
Insect scientists use the term "bed bug" in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient knowledge, literally "the knowledge of bedbugs," and refers to insects that have significantly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both "the deadly cockroach" and "the bed bug" are characterized by a long incubation period and adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the likelihood of females being affected by multiple sclerosis is twice as high as that of males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to make a building plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific methodology. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite that, it's not unique in this regard. Experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to examine the validity of one or more potential hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Gospel in Latin.
Accept Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence and production of internal cycles through biological clocks.
They trust the periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, belonging to most living organisms, including those specific to bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the oligonucleotides of the nuclear factor or its protein with radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are from germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wildlife, plants, and animals.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of that is visiting, filming, and learning information about this type of monkey (orangutangs) in Borneo.
People leave the small cities in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and on the way, they meet other people working at the place they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transportation, each person supports and is somewhat connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
The scientific evidence now indicates that this massive carbon-dependent economy has destabilized a biome that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Rarely do you hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems keep producing complaints like this? And why do they fail every day? Aren't the transport engineers competent? Or is something more fundamental happening there?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's not possible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable consistency; as a result, traffic flow exhibits reasonable consistency, and can be expressed approximately mathematically.
To clarify traffic flow better, they established relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that flew in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings backward along their body length.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Since thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, and many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the stars).
This makes sense, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries water eight times more than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, the pyramids of Giza are unmatched in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians were amazed in the modern kingdom by the آثار ( آثار ) of their ancestors, which had been built for more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most people working in the country, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the city of Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively easy way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, despite his assumption that they also transform into new materials to form what we observe.
Ingots are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And there are of course minerals like silver and gold too.
You can also get ingots containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. All matter was created from small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that trillions of them could fill the space of the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people, as it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People are writing letters now on computer screens, without needing to use a pen.
One can't help but wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the basis that it gathers energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core cracks open again, and a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with even a slight movement or without any movement.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The length of the shell fish reaches approximately 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He is thinner under Maria and thicker at higher altitudes.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come out onto the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest spontaneously upon reaching adulthood.
These theories investigate what makes some people want the things they do and the things in their surrounding environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two widely known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors may emerge when managers start leading people who are their peers: one is an attempt to stay "like the others" (or the others).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unfavorable decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
And on the opposite end, the individual transforms into someone unrecognizable, feeling that they must change everything the team was doing and possessed.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same distinction criteria as traditional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Generally, virtual team members act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
Generally, they tend to have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams, as their teams might convene according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a "hidden team" is described by (Larson and Lavasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Every member submits their reports to the "Invisible Team" management team. The "Invisible Team" then assesses each member against the established standards.
Why would any organization desire to establish an educational organization in a process that consumes a long time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
With the effective exploitation of all available resources through the organization's functional departments, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
Therefore, cooperation within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new, innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before the organization is able to innovate, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuity as a method used to help institutions reach a higher level of performance.
The availability of data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in the pursuit of knowledge. This thereby works to narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The connection between neurology and behavior supports scientists with their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in a way we never thought possible before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now being used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been used to develop several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of any school term. Often, the teacher might like to take her students to places where it's impossible to get there by bus.
Technology enables a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in the museum, visit the fish tank, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in class.
Virtual field trips are a nice way to remember a specific trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year. The website is redesigned annually, but the old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students usually begin their blogging experience with imperfect grammatical and spelling rules, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, the blogger starts in order to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to nourish public interest inspires students to be skilled and useful (Toto, 2004).
Documentation is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effectively responding to online materials, students can identify their positions in the context of others' writings, in addition to identifying their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, boasting a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You'll find Niagara Falls at the southern tip, and to the north, there are lands of natural beauty that haven't been exploited, even beyond Moscow.
All of these things, and more, shed light on Ontario as the thing considered the essence of Canada to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated, and some have almost no inhabitants.
To put things in perspective regarding the population figures that surprise many: the number of African Americans living in the United States of America is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island in the world, and it is a separate continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape.
The African coast borders the region to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, women traveling should declare that they are married.
It's better to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to know that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment and that it's common to monitor them and grab their hands, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your position (cultural differences shouldn't allow the matter to be accepted!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa," after its founding by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Badia, and the Spanish traders called it Casablanca, where they established commercial bases.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Finding places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city is easy, such as pottery, earthenware, leather goods, shisha pipes, and all kinds of cheap goods. However, all of this is specifically for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Ghuma was destroyed due to the lava of the Niragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of "Goma" are necessary to investigate in order to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the northern "Kifu" district, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city is also considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest gorilla trekking routes in Africa.
You can hire a boda-boda (a motorcycle used as a taxi) to tour the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides the difficulty in reaching it somewhat, "Timbuktu" has become used metaphorically for strange, distant lands.
Timbuktu is considered a poor city in our time, despite its reputation which made it a tourist attraction, in addition to the fact that it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Lewis Gates in his PBS series about the Wonders of the African World.
The city strongly differs from the rest of the country's cities, because it is characterized by a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, extending along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 square kilometers and it is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive areas in South Africa, and it is also considered a main park among the national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There are daily fees to maintain the park and enter it, like all national parks in South Africa.
It's better for you to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you to enter a selection of South African parks, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island grants the territory of Hong Kong its due name, and it is the place that many tourists consider a must-see.
The lined buildings resembling the Hong Kong skyline are like a dazzling chart displayed above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island and wander to the Marine area in Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made as their own special place; therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal belt of mangrove forests in the world, extending for a distance of 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the remote areas of Bangladesh and India along the coast.
They declared Sundarbans a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest area located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just swamps for mangrove trees; they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense thickets that once covered the Ganges River plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, approximately one-third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates indicate that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the internal station between the regions (across the river) during the day, despite most of them, especially those going to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because the buses that run between the neighborhoods are usually full, it's better to buy your tickets in advance, a few days ahead of time.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of transportation to neighboring places, such as Baro (Nu 150) and Bunakha (Nu 200).
The Ouyabouk River bridge is a suspension bridge. It extends over the Ouyabouk River to connect the cities of Ouyabouk with Brazil and Saint George do Ouyabouk in French Guiana.
The towers reach a height of 83 meters, and their length is 378 meters, with two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
It was supposed for the bridge to start operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints was expected.
The "Guaraní" were the most important native group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay. The Guaraní people lived as semi-nomadic hunters and practiced subsistence farming as well.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived on hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged, which was previously known as the "Colossal Province of the Spice Islands" as a result of a confrontation between the Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spanish colonial period began, lasting for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in December, at polo fields in Las Canitas.
In addition, you can watch smaller tournaments and matches here at different times of the year.
To get news about championships and places to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in Stanley, located on the other side of the FIC West store, for islands.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar is accepted quite often.
In remote islands, there's a chance they might not accept credit cards, although they might accept British and US currency; check with the owners beforehand to know the accepted payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands money outside the islands, so you need to exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, the summer season there occurs when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical regions; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make the air feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rain remains approximately constant throughout the year, as there are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Despite many of the animals in the park being used to seeing humans, wildlife is wild at the end of the day and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, please stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile or compliant they may appear, the bison, gazelles, goats, bears, and almost all large animals may attack.
Many guests get hurt every year because they don't stay far away, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to provide a special area for it.
In addition to that, be careful because smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong odor and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Apolo, and its population is just under 40,000 people.
Abya was founded in the 1950s of the 19th century and served as the official capital of Hadramaut from 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British destroyer. Around 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by Mao's movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the Supreme Leader, Tobwa Tamasis Liloufi III.
Due to Oakland's location between two ports, there are many beaches there, and the most popular one is located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, making swimming safe, and most of them are shaded by botokwa trees.
The beaches of Taraki Road are located on the ports of Witimata, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches can be crowded at times with a good selection of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The popular basic beer is known as "Number One"; it's not a complex drink, but rather an enjoyable and refreshing one. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines might spread more.
The water from the local tap is perfectly safe for drinking, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is "espresso," while a cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and they serve tea without milk.
The chocolate candy is compliant with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, even though their price is extremely high.
They conduct many trips to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reefs rarely occur from any of these reasons.
Nevertheless, seek advice from the authorities, abide by all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.

Most of the fatalities spoke of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you swim outside the current, the swim back is no less easy than usual.
Try to target a place where the current doesn't control you again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone has noticed your presence, waiting for rescue might be a second option.
