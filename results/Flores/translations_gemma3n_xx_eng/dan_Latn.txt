In December 2017, Siminoff appeared on the TV channel QVC for a shopping show.
Ring also reached a settlement with the competing security company, ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, there have so far been no medications that have been shown to be usable in treating an existing infection.
The antibody cocktail ZMapp initially showed promise in the area, but formal studies indicated that it was less effective than anticipated in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and accepts the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization instead of decertification.

This confirms not only that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The findings also provide insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The absence of structure suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or decoration. The researchers believed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken down.
Researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual and not chicken down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found out that the sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy exists around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of masses of small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming from the power plant.
Residents near the facility were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, turn off their air conditioners, and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and that there was reason for alarm due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.
In about a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of XDR-TB within the entire human population with tuberculosis appears to remain low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people in South Africa at a given time.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, which will help the healthcare system prepare for next year.
The plans for delivering vaccines to the areas historically hardest hit this year were delayed due to a lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish postal service and became their chief engraver.
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is of such quality and detail that he is one of the very few "household names" among philatelists. Some specialize in collecting only his work.

Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations between day and night suggest they are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stably as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate into an envelope.
When officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988, so voters and observers can see that the boxes do not contain ballots at the start of the vote, and that no other ballots are added than those that have been correctly counted and come from authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and according to specific procedures.

In her second race, which was giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated category with an overall race time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four para-alpine skiers in the women's seated category did not finish the race, and 45 of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not place.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is in pre-trial detention and awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
This is standard practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish images of suspects, etc."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, as well as the issues surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only accept leaving the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial should be closely monitored by park rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effects were evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
A new provisional electoral board (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures intended to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the extensive anti-government protests that began in October was a commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The North Marianas Emergency Operations Center reported that no injuries had been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
More hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the seat of an elderly woman when she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs during the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even wilder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The then-appointed Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the survey's various extremes, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there has been doubt about his condition.
He couldn't take the medication necessary to combat his pain because it is prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed this discovery at the beginning of February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have possibly been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life. **Note:** While grammatically correct, the Danish sentence has a slight redundancy ("muligvis have været" - "possibly have been"). The translation reflects this slightly awkward phrasing. A more natural English phrasing might be: "Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life."
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and particularly how Earth was formed since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and foolishness."
One speculates whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on ground-based radars, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be put in place, and trains above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, despite expectations that this process would have taken much longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch *Geospiza fortis* and the invasive cactus finch *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn out into a thin cable that can be coiled and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books, which were called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Protons are particles that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system in almost all houses.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses in the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women socialized together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down again almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a special task that every cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cat species and live in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides react very much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a series of snorting, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find prey (animals to eat) through scents, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (as if they migrate over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have other features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than was previously necessary.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two population groups will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its time, and feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an extra set on top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate a number of strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes they built pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't very important.
The Jewish family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled by a few people. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the note was simply attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was governed by the French Vichy government – which comprised French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people who live together and cooperate, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, and is related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state; and it also defines, in some way, the size of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization's culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, they were dependent on the state authorities, which were often unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all actions.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often described, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history begins as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a change in the indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still photography is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, which might seem confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (for example, the APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The very misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also maintaining a certain order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was examined more closely.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically used for this purpose.
The Church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being properly upheld.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching their destination. This blockade was in violation of recognized international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
As there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similarly strong reaction to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations leaned towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations sought to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents on him, a poetry collection, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were depicted in a unique way; each Chinese period or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, there was fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, the positions were open to all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, for instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-curve" mark looks like a V, and the "down-curve" mark looks like a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and pull the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
Overcoats usually produce a softer sound, while undercoats sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed bar markings are determined by musical reasons, therefore they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming crowd of people who were shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the mafia showed the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines were required to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the majority of expenses, and bond interest flowed through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprofits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that underpinned the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology as a driving force or technological necessity to a narrow idea that humanity's fate is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws, and the way these laws manifest themselves in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on society that is inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the motorcar necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare sector to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with the Romantic period, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with society's location and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury since approximately 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most widespread during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was greatly inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could fall 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce enough food to merely meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the bioregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel overlooked by societal norms, and give them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abandonment, have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been deprived of their freedom by people (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect was caused by parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to that of the animal that cared for the child, such as its fears or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method in itself, but a support for people who need to learn something new - for example, how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little stick figure in Microsoft Office.
Virtual tutors are internalized within the software and aim to question, solicit, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to manage alone.
Children come to foster families for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care, and education, but nonetheless they do.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
A foster family has the task of providing all the necessities that were not available in the home they were removed from.
The internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further dimensions in terms of application and approach to satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets like dogs, for example.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added through mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations through selection.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible. It also provides large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a manner somewhat similar to how chimpanzees do it today on the savanna.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based suggestions involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to get up and relieve oneself.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is completely opposite to the amount of tension a person holds in their body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the path of loving-kindness Mahayana and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Center for Tibetan Meditation practices Deity Yoga ("Deity Yoga"). Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the differences in the countries' systems, processes, and cultures led to them opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fiercely fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, quickly became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army occupied and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's traditional task has been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time impacting your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans attempted to transport soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders who were frequently children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, roads were built in England.
Although the lanes consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the somewhat uneven roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early on to hold the rails in place. However, it was soon realized that rails would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, which were made exclusively of metal.
The first known method of transportation was to walk. People began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and on July 9th he had it read aloud to his soldiers in New York. An экземпляр arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, for now, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or poisonous household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression comes from old knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both ticks and bedbugs are obligate parasites, which means they are adapted to live in their host's home or nest.
Across the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of developing MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child to have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific investigations.
However, experimentation doesn't stand alone, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made within physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms that are not reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape as well as the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
How every morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplaces, and pass others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now believes that the decarbonized economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the individual drivers' and vehicles' movements between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flows because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) stream, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These considerations help with planning, designing, and operating road construction projects.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the housefly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some believed he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
It seems logical, because we can't feel the Earth spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the Earth's second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is up to six miles (approximately 9.6 km) wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in the size of their constructions or their technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine if one has the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many substances in the periodic system.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is being used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay under little or no influence.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the leading side and 100 km thick on the trailing side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be several lunar lava flows on the foreground, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories investigate what it is about certain people that makes them perform specific actions, and which elements in their environment lead them to perform or refrain from performing specific actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behavioral patterns can emerge when a manager begins to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is attempting to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
Despite everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise apply to virtual teams as to conventional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual teammates often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique aspect of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments.
As a result of this, the process within an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve a higher performance level.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI encompasses the ability to create machines that can automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice recognition, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, with a focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military sectors, as it has been integrated into numerous home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good method for evaluating a field trip and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but old versions are still available online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, "blogging compels students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active responses to online materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas of unspoiled natural beauty.
All of these things, and more, highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Further north, there are large areas that are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's sensible to wear something that looks like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it's very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Despite Goma being relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the conflicts taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Along with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of threatened World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and access fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a collection of buildings that, due to their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar graph.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however—they encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses that are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxies are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, for example Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011. It first opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaranis were the most significant group of indigenous people who lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also cultivated land for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was previously called "India's great province," came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population groups.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams and some of the world's best players.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Even smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can inquire with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to that of a British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currency may be usable; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures are usually above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, bears, and pretty much all large animals can readily attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing smelly food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence, organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the murder of the highest chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most of them get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most popular local beer is "Number One," which isn't a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be easier to transport.
It is certainly safe to drink the local tap water, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent in return.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from authorities, read and follow advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sandflies occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have special offers on certain hotels, even though you might be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you should arrive early to get a tent spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages is over, there might still be parts of the festival playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy, especially for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see the terms and conditions), which is good to know as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and retain them.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered on the house. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is going to drive in high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is low friction, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
Under a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly year-round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what attracts the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to trips to see the impressive African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment is therefore sufficient to spot them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walk-safari" or "walking safari") consists of hikes that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, as the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have the opportunity to use an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are various ways to purify water, with some being more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for a minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them from home.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit diseases.
Contagious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people, are normally not perceived as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often goes through isolated terrain in the countryside.
Be careful if you're not used to driving on country roads: there are plenty of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The speed limits they have set are remarkably lower than on the stretches before and after — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to observe them exactly.
Surprisingly, mobile phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very flavorful and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Furthermore, much German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand.
If you fancy some small but rich cakes, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further explanation, it typically refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a range of single, spiced dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can pose safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety straps that release the stirrup leathers from the saddle if they are pulled backward by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks offer breathtaking views from the summits for all visitors. Climbers from around the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, encompassing skiing and snowboarding, are popular recreational activities involving descending snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bumbers" - who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years – cave paintings dating all the way back to 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates all the way back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but normally does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should view the ski route as if it were a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you were walking – but it is very rare that you will achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a trip through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this context, however, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding it is also important to many Sámi people with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi people kept reindeer on a large scale, but they made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, mainly using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the word "sigøjner" (gypsy) is often used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel advisories are issued for the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you would like to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be formulated for their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often a general and simplified overview of the matter, compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious social disruption or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur worldwide, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather, like thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, fogs, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as this could impact any travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" will likely give the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually including practical experience.
A course will typically last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapon training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there aren't many publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgeries abroad should ensure they bring valid documents for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or documents that are updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checks have also become more intrusive since the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgeries should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the shore, often at a reef or similar formation, is called a rip current.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, where a strong deep-water current can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you break free from the current, it's no harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you might wait for rescue.
The shock of returning home comes faster than culture shock (there isn't as much a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a very difficult time adapting to their own culture.
When you come home again after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that a traveler in a completely new country needs to adapt.
People don't necessarily expect it to be necessary to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set as the background and tells of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera creates a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet on the high plateau and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range holds Antarctica's highest mountains, Vinson Massif (also known as Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used by shipping, including leisure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those who leave school, as it allows them to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place on a higher education program in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailors. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagoes and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is a little reminiscent of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (for example, in Holland the number is one to forty).
On most Baltic cruises, an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia, is offered.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only stay within the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
It can be a daunting experience to travel by plane for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before, or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no shame in it: it's no different than the fear and hatred towards other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Delivery companies charge a premium for fast delivery. Often, time is crucial when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller businesses, there was a problem.
If they sent things via air freight, it could have taken days for them to clear customs and be processed on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines' rules don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to lay down a large pile of money to get the opportunity (or even better, have your company do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a rough guideline, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price of economy class for business class and eleven times the price of first class!
Generally speaking, there's no need to look for discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also spoken to a large extent.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member states of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial city situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-facade buildings, and modern shopping centers are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs, the old market from the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves placed over some gravestones.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around the interesting village.
Northward and within reach lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a laudatory account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Northwards, you can also visit the large shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), which is the site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Remember, you are actually visiting a mass grave site. A place of crucial importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time there, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place with markings or by scratching graffiti onto the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs are, however, only indicated in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are announced via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible; you should act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it significantly easier to get around.
The Parisians' cool exterior quickly evaporates if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forest areas - mainly beech and coniferous trees - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here, alongside many more common species, one finds rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and moose.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have headscarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially some with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, it is required that men wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not be entirely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and the use of a good deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
That undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and improve your understanding of sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it that you don't need to study it separately.
Former astronomical observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution wasn't such a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern astronomical telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at blossoming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you should resist the temptation to "just take one sample."
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally considered a very safe place to visit and very easy to get around in, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you find yourself in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you're considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhone Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from around the world have adopted many of the holiday traditions.
There's a tradition of staying up on Easter night to watch the sunrise from a high vantage point.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, where the congregations often erupt in celebration at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been imported, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit arctic or antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there aren't many people living in the areas, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, and therefore emphasizes teamwork over praise for individual achievements.
The workers often need their superiors to approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
