ZMapp served as the control in the PALM study, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
The American Gymnastics Association supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the need for the Olympic family to ensure a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving towards a significant change in our organization, rather than through decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely popular, but also provides details that fossils as a whole do not offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers on the top of this animal were chestnut-brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also allows us to gain insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called the rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – branches and barbs – researchers conclude that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. According to researchers, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows plumage from an adult specimen, not chick down.
Researchers suggest that although this may be the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult, not down from a juvenile.

The light and rotation used together determine the Rossby number of the star, associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in its magnetic reversal.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory claims that most dark matter surrounding a given galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Traditionally, voting in France is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, indicate their chosen candidate on a pre-printed sheet of paper, and place it in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, he or she drops the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The French election law quite strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that at the beginning of the voting process there are no envelopes inside and that no other envelopes are inserted except those from properly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

At the Giant Slalom competition, she finished in tenth place in the seated women's category with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian Gyorgy Dani, who finished ninth.
Four women from the seated skiing group did not complete their laps, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K.ariya stated that the five people who raped the Swiss woman have been arrested, and her mobile phone and laptop have been returned to her.
Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of the accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened is temporarily closed so that emergency services can extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoa has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody, awaiting an indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be tainted because her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and courts view the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for the criminal prosecution, told journalists that no further comments will be made until charges are filed.
According to the information released, the document will concern the dispute over borders that Palestine seeks based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
It is assumed that the other reflected topics are about the future state of Jerusalem, holy to both sides, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania has agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the test was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the Australian Sports shooters Association's shooting program, qualified volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Sports shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Heritage and Conservation at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received detailed safety instructions and training.
Martelli swore an oath before the new nine-member temporary electoral council yesterday.
This is Martel's fifth temporary electoral council in four years.
Last month, a commission to the president recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to facilitate the country's move towards new elections.
Martell's response to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October, was a commission.
Violent protests were sometimes triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been anticipated since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod devices are reported to be malfunctioning. Overheating is reported to have caused a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company called "minor."
The Ministry responded, calling the postponement of the Apple report "a genuine regret."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Agency of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that there has been no damage to the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and there are at least six confirmed fatalities so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendosa was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a medical career.
She trained to be a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Legins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone is applied, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators discovered two flight recorders, also known as "black boxes," on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Tribute was paid to Luna by fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremism. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman."
"Luna is strange like me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... let's hope she's in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose the idea of turning Australia into a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
Julia Gillard, who was serving as Prime Minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of those surveyed who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Ultimately, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtiss Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how Earth formed, after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
There are speculations that he/she will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, unlike the older ground-radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and pinpoint the precise location of aircraft.
No additional transport will be provided, and the наземни влакове (ground trains) will not stop at Wembley. There is no parking available at the venue, and no parking facilities are available for leaving vehicles.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal "Science" reports the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species have evolved in just two generations, despite it being thought that this process takes much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be reshaped into any form. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn as a thin wire, which can be braided and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. So thin, in fact, that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is the pH of a chemical substance. By using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is, green juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances together, and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you'll feel it a little strange, and something like a film will form.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women gathered together in mixed company.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing we have thanks to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
He/She gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that feed on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specialized role that each cat occupies, which protects it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The harems consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are typically closely connected, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Pride dynamics are very similar to wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five healthy men.
The tiger also belongs to the same group (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones characterized by a roar.
The roar of a tiger does not fully resemble a lion's roar, but rather resembles the utterance of growling, shouting words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track down and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate where they were.
With their nocturnal vision, they see very well in the dark and move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, so that return is difficult), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations from before to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will diverge so much that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from them. Most edible foods are plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper part of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could not compare to it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had quite a few strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate, sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to hold banquets together, lounging aside while they ate.
It is not possible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor potatoes, nor tomatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a first-rate temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such importance.
The majority of the Jewish family's life takes place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just shelves overlooking the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, therefore timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already been living there by that time.
Despite each of the countries being "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie "National Treasure."
However, that is not true. It's not a treasure map, although there is something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is displayed at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Most likely, the notation was added only as a label.
With the landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French Vichy regime. These were Frenchmen who made a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, American and French forces liberate Southern France and move towards Germany.
Civilization represents a culture shared by a significant and large group of people who work and live together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "citizenly," related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and this somehow defines the size of society.
City-states were precursors to nations. Culture, within the context of civilization, implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and natural dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with the Congress being its sole component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since it lacked national judicial or executive authority, it relied on state bodies, which often refused to cooperate in the implementation of all its acts.
He/She also has no power to reject tax laws and international tariffs.
The clauses required unanimous consent from all countries to be amended, and the countries treated the central government so unseriously that their representatives often didn't attend.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world. They were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often called an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes to the local customs of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the complex's borders have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the era of analog film.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the image formats of digital camera sensors.
The 35-mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest common denominator for integers) is therefore 3:2.
Formats that are equal to or very close to this ratio are very common (for example, a group of APS formats).
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline that creates dynamic composition while also maintaining a sense of order within the image.
It specifies that the most suitable place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (See the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become rich and powerful, came under criticism.
Christianity has connected European countries for over a thousand years, despite linguistic differences and various customs.
His pervasive power affected everyone – from the king to the common person.
A fundamental Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the church in Rome has continued for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads many to question whether this principle has been upheld.
The United Kingdom began a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
Despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies.
The United Kingdom is mining international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean zones, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unlimited naval operations with submarines.
In the 1920s, among most citizens and nations, an attitude of pacifism and isolation prevailed.
The peoples wanted to avoid a military situation again in the future, after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I.
To accept a job at Edison's company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrives in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batcheller (his manager from his previous job).
In Ancient China, there existed a unique way of showcasing different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest place in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, education was opened to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of a unit in the army being based on class, now it is based on caliber.
The French Revolution served as inspiration for many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. To meditate, he often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount Nur (of light).
The cave itself, having survived the passage of time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists to this day.
Raised by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
In Egypt's Valley of the Kings, on the Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his wives and family members.
The "bow upwards" sign resembles a V, and the "bow downwards" sign resembles a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start from the top and pull the bow, while down means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow), then pull it back.
An upward-pointing bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward-pointing bow is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to widely open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed in Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid the military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The US colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The super-profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people represent, of course, fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of the Templars, the context that led to the order's creation must be clear.
The period in which the events occurred is usually called the Late Middle Ages – the period of European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice – from the technological impetus or technological imperative to the strong feeling that human destiny is guided by a logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two common ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, or the technology itself impacts inherent, rather than socially conditioned, societies.
For example, one could say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically beneficial for just a few cars; therefore, new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars has also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, necessitating the development of new medical techniques for the recovery of injured bodies.
Romanticism contains a significant element of cultural determinism, the origins of which are laid by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture become associated with that geography, and being in harmony with the place of society, they were considered better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and continues until around 1100 BC.
Her status declined during the twelfth century primarily because the Crusaders returned with goods like spices and silk, which were more valued than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes, which is one of the most significant developments of that time.
Agriculture as a means of livelihood is that type of farming carried out for the production of enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Market gardening is a simple, often organic system, frequently using heirloom seeds from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively straightforward techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for sustenance, and this still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as independent can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a given subculture often signal their membership through characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, poor treatment, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "untamed" or wild. Some untamed children have been kept locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children, before being abandoned or running away, may have been severely maltreated or traumatized.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived wild in the wilderness.
When a wild child is fully raised by animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely resembling that of the specific animal raising it, as well as its fears or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning aims to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Building scaffolding is not a method of training, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Skeletons can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of skeleton, just like the little person with the paperclips in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons designed to ask questions, provide reminders, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for many and varied reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, nurturing, and educational, but this happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
It is assumed that our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, as well as reliable healthcare.
Home care is expected to provide everything that was lacking in the home from which the person was taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the use of the satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imel and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is stated more specifically that a person can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out that despite those who cannot understand speech due to brain damage being able to perceive genuine emotion.
He even suggests that similar abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Studies throughout the 20th century showed that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the forward-and-backward variations between the two gene pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its need for amino acids through the available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources to access would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but they are difficult for us to digest unless they are cooked.
Unlike plant-based foods (termites, ants, eggs), animal-based foods are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and falling back asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that gently brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less stress there is, the more life-affirming it is. Every person has the potential to discover absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Our own tension and negativity are the only things standing in our way of reaching that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is further developed through many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of loving-kindness.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, visualizations, and mantras.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, differences in system, process, and culture led to conflict between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had already become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years and involved a real fight through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
However, these plans became invalid in a matter of one night when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after seizing the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move a huge number of people and cargo across the oceans.
The traditional task of naval fleets is to ensure your country's ability to move its people and goods while simultaneously interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the last most remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to get people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy is trying to stop this trafficking, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goat herders who were usually children or young men, similar to the more widely known sheepdog. These herding methods are still used today.
Railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railway tracks consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the uneven roads characteristic of that time.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early on to hold the rails in place. However, it gradually became clear that the rails would be more effective with an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Gradually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known way to move was walking, as people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or the upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, generally did not walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join an environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce the negative impacts to some extent in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being passed by the Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixson in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 extant single copies of Dunlap on large sheets, of which the existence is still known, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Since they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have clawed feet and scales, walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and lay eggs.
Almost all computers used today function based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits – or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are very common, making it difficult to diagnose right away.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "bubolechka" is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from long-standing knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both flying ants and ordinary ants are colorless and live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that the probability of having MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Upon adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although experiments are also used to eliminate some possible hypotheses, asking questions, and using guidelines also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and especially with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself detached from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are more than just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform the cycle of free running, even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading assumptions that DNA is the genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hersh and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted in which either the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people with an interest in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
The activities that can be carried out here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to their workplaces, people travel from small provincial towns by car, and pass by others whose destination is the place the first ones have just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected to and supports the transport system through private cars.
It is now being shown by science that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person is a part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Since the behavior of drivers, unfortunately, cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a certain logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of movement, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and ultimately the operation of road infrastructure.
Insects are the first animals to have flown in the air. Their ability to fly has helped them avoid predators more easily, find food, and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that can't fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many hold the opposite view – that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river in the world. It carries over 8 times more water than the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching 6 miles wide in places.
The Amazon discharges a full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles). Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unparalleled in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is around 800 people. It is the country with the smallest population and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most people who work in the country.
All subjects of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements – earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, this was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, there are alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, and that matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a single point at the end of this sentence.
So, when it appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens and don't need to sharpen pencils.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
A nuclear-plutonium bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, separating the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which makes them prone to decay with a small nudge or without one.
The lunar surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
She is thinner by the seas and thicker by the mountains.
There may be more seas on the far side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness focus on discovering what makes people resonate with something or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what drives certain people to desire the things they do and which elements in their environment will lead them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation" are the two most popular content theories.
Generally speaking, once managers start leading their former colleagues, two types of behavior may emerge. On one side, there are those who try to remain "I'm one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager encounters difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
A person transforms, on the other end of the spectrum, into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the leadership team to whom each member reports. This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? Innovation is, in practice, one of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the organization's problem-solving process can lead to a new and innovative process serving the needs of the client.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational training and shared knowledge.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher results.
Physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is provided by neurobiological data. This narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between pathology and brain behavior supports the scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although artificial intelligence has great significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with the learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that can automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Some of the examples that can be cited are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Similar problems have evolved into separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system that is built into several home computer and video game software applications is now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of school education. Teachers often wish they could take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a trip in practice is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website documenting their trip to the state capital. Each year this website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a reference.
Blogs can be helpful for improving students' writing. While students often start out with blogs having poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes this fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger has started striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be interesting and intelligent (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, students can be enabled to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials in the context of other people's writings, students can define their positions and also outline their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming and bilingual capital city of Canada, where you can find a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is even further south, while the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding lands lies to the north.
All of these things solidify Ontario's image as a model of typical Canadianism in the eyes of foreigners.
The large northern regions are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable deserts.
A surprising comparison of the population: the number of African Americans in the US is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and, in itself, a separate continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations or are linked to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route "Cape of Good Hope," the maritime path from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the west and south with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that every traveling woman state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can create situations they consider harassment, which often involve being followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Cidadela Branca" (White Citadel), but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan restores the city as Dar el-Bayda, and the name Casablanca is received from Spanish merchants who establish their trading posts there.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes (narghiles), and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded much of the city's streets, especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Timbuktu, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has acquired the use as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite being transformed into a tourist attraction due to its reputation and having an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS show "The Specials Wonders of the African World."
The city sharply differs from the other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends eastward along the border with Mozambique, with Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park extends over 19,500 km², divided into 14 separate eco-zones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Normally, all South African national parks require daily entrance and park conservation fees.
It might also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The row of buildings that form the silhouette of Hong Kong resemble a glittering columnar chart, highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To explore Hong Kong best, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed area of Hong Kong Island is densely built on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers appropriated, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start here.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. This part of the forest, located on Indian territory, is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only made up of mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remaining remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², with almost a third of this territory covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are already 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the intercity bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumtang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
It is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis represent a fast and convenient means of travel for short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with 2 sails each having a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to plan, the bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant local tribe, whose members inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, also practicing agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guayкуру and Payaguá, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the local tribes.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for one of the best polo teams and individual players in the world.
The largest annual tournament is held in December at the polo field in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at a different time of the year.
Check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news regarding tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has the same value as one British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and American dollars are also often accepted within the "Stanley" credit card system.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the Outer Islands, but British and American currency may be used; it's best to speak with the hosts beforehand to understand which payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; temperatures above +30 °C are normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and dampness creates a feeling of colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not enter their personal space.
In addition, please keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking fragrant food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 people.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1750s.
In 1889, a scandalous naval clash occurred at the port when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships have sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lose their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the "Mau" movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of Supreme Chief Tuputu Tamasese Lealoifi III.
Since Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach to the north to Devenport to the south.
Almost all are guarded sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade under the rustling trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are by Waitetama Harbour, on the outskirts of the affluent areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One." It's not a heavy beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines for tasting, but New Zealand and Australian wines might go down better.
The tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you're worried.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino is loaded with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are a bit pricey, but delicious.
Many of the trips to the reef are year-round, and accidents on the reef, caused by any of these reasons, are rare.
Nevertheless, pay attention to the authorities' advice, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of city 1770. They can sometimes be encountered outside of this period as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is at the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides passengers with peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you can also find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a vast majority of attendees decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll need to arrive earlier to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there might be festival stages where music will continue to be played late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as crossing over the ice in the most affected areas causes a very terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms and conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
To keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment deals.
In some places, free alcoholic beverages are offered. However, intoxication affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited during snowfall or whiteout conditions, as well as by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icing and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic moves almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris may represent the greatest tourist interest in Africa and are a final destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to a land journey for viewing the amazing African wildlife, more specifically in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are prone to approaching cars more closely, resulting in a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best observed with binoculars.
Hiking safari (also known as "wilderness walk," "tourist safari," or "hiking") is a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will take place at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, following its hosting of the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the season was postponed, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Expectations are that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available, even if they aren't in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, burning).
Water can be purified in various ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others several minutes are required.
Filters have varying degrees of effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests and animals not native to their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are usually not classified as pests themselves.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding or following sections, where they are typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h), and however, strict adherence to them is more important than in other places.
It's interesting, however, that the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian ones are quite lavish and diverse, similar to those made in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are commonly found; apples are used in pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, albeit rich pastries, try those which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be discovered throughout the country.
However, if used without additional specification, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, widely spread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes numerous simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors preferred by the Javanese being chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but concerns about safety may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
In the event a rider is thrown from a horse and their leg gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Afterward, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Kochamó Valley – the best destination for climbers in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and routes.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes amidst the endless potential of the walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing dates back as a sport at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first sports ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
They are similar, but they usually don't include ski touring in alpine style or mountaineering, as the latter takes place on steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as similar to a hiking one.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking – but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly applying for visas and undergoing passport control.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent like a single country in this regard.
While you are within the territory of this zone, you can generally cross borders without passing through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you possess a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member states, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods qualify as antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit can be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though they are not as old as mass-produced antiques.
Raising reindeer is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this livelihood is also important to many with other crafts.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer primarily serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is a profitable industry in Saami, one of the regions where the Sámi live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate representations of the Romanian people.
If the country you are visiting is included in the travel information bulletin, this may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You might want to consult with other governments as well, but the advice from those governments is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Meetings are nothing more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The presented opinions are often superficial, general, and too simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the main term for any hazardous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social problems, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and its manifestations are very diverse and can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and influences of severe weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers should be aware of the risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these may impact any travel plans.
Every person planning a visit to a country that may be designated as a military zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company will likely be provided when searching online for "hostile environment course".
The course typically covers all the topics discussed here, but in much greater detail and usually with practical exercises.
The course is usually 2 to 5 days long and includes role-playing, many first aid activities, and sometimes weapon handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications addressing military zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for returning home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to individuals with non-binary gender (X) or to update documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents is also a variable.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more thorough since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who are scheduled to undergo surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Dead currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the shore, often near a reef or something similar.
The return flow, due to the underwater topography, is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you won't be caught again, or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The shock of returning comes faster than culture shock (there's a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it relatively easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, where you have adapted to the new culture there, you have lost some of your habits from the culture at home.
Initially, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that those arriving in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for passengers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of light and sound is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and storyteller of a long tale.
The scenes are presented on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which boasts a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Elsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bering Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula flow into the plateau, after which they rise again to form a 360 km range of Ellsworth Mountains, dissected by the Minot Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In remote areas with no mobile phone coverage, your only option might be a satellite phone.
Satellite phones generally do not replace mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors with a direct line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice data.
More information about connecting to this service can be provided by your local phone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, giving them a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the missed year would improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
There is usually a "training" fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boat trips. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands located in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is from 1 to 40).
Most reputable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you will be able to visit the historical city for two full days, returning and sleeping on the ship overnight.
If you disembark using shore excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
This is not something we should be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and hatred towards other things that a large number of people have.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes, and for smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they shipped goods by air, unloading and clearing customs may take days on some routes.
The only way to expedite the process was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's rules do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is your situation.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or even better, to have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay up to four times more than the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Basically, it doesn't make sense to even look for discounts for business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a specific core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are accordingly charged for it.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the separation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which, despite having its own government and currency, is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of approximately 3.7 million people, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains, the once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere in the city is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik has a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, above some tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around the fascinating village.
A short distance north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendor, written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly travels to Sintra, stopping in Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the beautiful Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), a place of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of immeasurable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many surviving men and women who survived here, and many others who had relatives and loved ones killed or died from work there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make light of the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not deface the property by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan because, by law, it is the first official language.
At the same time, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other establishments.
In the metro, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the automated system announces unplanned disruptions in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to navigate Paris is still to be polite and behave in a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) way. This will significantly ease your sightseeing.
The rough appearance of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a little politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park features dense forests, mainly of beech, spruce, and fir, with a mixed alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the variety of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, there is an extremely high diversity of plant communities.
The region is also home to an exceptionally large variety of animals and birds.
Rare fauna species, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and roe deer, can be seen there, along with many other common species.
During their visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you'll receive a smile from the monk or nun right at the entrance.
Following the same logic, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
Clothing can be borrowed from what's available at the entrance, but it isn't washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all men!
Like in similar zones in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pamboli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever product is available, like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" (you), are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important rule for distinguishing some verbs from nouns.
It is assumed that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to understand whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are "c" and "g," as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce R and RR differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means chariot.
Persian is an easy language with a relatively regular grammar.
Therefore, this grammar guide will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish, however, might quickly decide that Portuguese is close enough to the language that they don't need to study it separately.
These observatories, which were common before today's modern ones, are now typically outdated and are used today as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem even at its peak as it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing the cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the plum blossom is the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy within the Imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one."
You will be ejected without discussion for picking "samples" while visiting a well-maintained garden.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place. It's very easy to get around, and you can also buy almost anything after you arrive.
But having fallen into the "deep tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less often, when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north towards Hebron, where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are traditionally buried.
Check the bus you're planning to take to make sure it goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good basis for a vacation theme.
For example, exploring castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world as well.
There's a tradition to spend Easter night awake outdoors to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is also possible that it represents a pre-Christian spring ritual for fertility.
More traditional churches often organize Easter vigils on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with the congregation often beginning lively celebrations as midnight approaches to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or rafting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which turned the giant tortoise into the first herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats, and dogs were brought there.
If you visit the regions of the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and, therefore, low pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, with an emphasis on group efforts rather than rewarding individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors for every decision they make and are expected to follow their instructions without complaint.
