Furthermore, Ring settled a lawsuit with competing security company ADT Corporation.
Although one experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing the Ebola mortality rate, no cure has yet clearly shown itself to be usable for treating existing infections.
An initial antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicate that it is less useful than desired in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a benchmark to compare three other treatments against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and acknowledges that the Olympic family certainly needs the development of a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the UOK declaration that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than by becoming stagnant with a certificate.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse within the system, so bravely described by survivors of Larry Nassar, could remain unnoticed for so long, and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOH share the same goal—to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
From 1960, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor, and later for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.
During the 1976 elections, he advised Carter on foreign policy, later serving as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.
How did Kissinger assist Carter with the diplomatic handling of world affairs, such as the Camp David Accords in 1978; the normalization of relations between the United States and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian Revolution, which followed the Iran hostage crisis; the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979?

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot offer, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaurian feathers lack a well-developed filament, called a rachis, but do have other feather features—branches and barbs—researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development than those other features.
According to the structure of the feathers, it is assumed that they were not used for flight, but rather more likely for thermoregulation or display. The researchers conjectured that the specimen shows a fully grown plumage and not juvenile down, although it is a tail from a young dinosaur.
The explorers conjectured that the specimen shows a mature plumage and not juvenile down, even though it is a tail from a young dinosaur.
A bomb in a car exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.
The government office reported that nineteen of the injured were police officers.

They found that the Sun functions according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system appeared to be driven by nothing other than their luminosity and their rotation.
Brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby index, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic inversions.

The Iraq Exploration Group presented its report at 12:00 GMT today.
It warns: No one can guarantee that any way of acting in Iraq will now halt interfaith fighting, growing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The Report begins with a call for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States regarding policy related to the Middle East.
The report heavily criticizes almost every nuance of the current executive's policy regarding Iraq and urges an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative must be undertaken by the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interference and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.
Current Senator and First Lady of Argentina Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidential post last evening in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theater, the same location where she began her campaign to be elected to the Senate in 2005, as a member of the delegation of the province of Buenos Aires.
The debate was caused by disagreement over the expenditures for rescue and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, which some financial conservatives already humorously nicknamed the "Bush's New Orleans affair."
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction efforts focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to alleged foreign allies of Washington.

The work done was mostly theoretical, yet the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was searching for the effect caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the most mysterious matter around a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very annoying and alarming, because it has a very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected by the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two of them are hospital staff.
During one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people.
However, the prevalence of XDR-TB in the entire group of tuberculosis patients appears to be small; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in the large caverns of the Earth, which often retain a sufficiently constant temperature, but it corresponds with those that are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the U.S. Geological Survey and of Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally a technologically simple process: voters would isolate themselves in a booth, place the pre-printed ballot paper with an indication of their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter inserts the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sufficiently strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes present before the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those of the correctly calculated and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's group of sitters failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the downhill race.
The police of Madja-Pradeŝo recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Assistant to Chief Inspector D. K. Arya said: "We arrested five people who sexually assaulted the Swiss woman, and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with shielded faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver received serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while rescue workers freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya remained at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court from then on, accused of murdering his son.
She is being held while awaiting formal accusation and trial, but any deposition from a witness could be influenced, as her image has been widely publicized.
It's customary practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish law works differently, and courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be approaching a dangerous line if they publish photos or other details about suspects."
The Crown Office, which generally is responsible for prosecution, clarified to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the report, the document refers to the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to have based on the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other related topics, it is said, will include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow the presence for only five years.
The p flame throwers in the trial of helpful plague control had to be carefully inspected by the forester, while the trial was being studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are recruited within the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, a substitute for the Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected marksmen for the first firing operation received detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in to a new nine-member Portempa Election Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a strategy to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the unsuccessful organization of elections, some of which were postponed from 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating in non-functioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, MEKI announced that Apple informed it of 34 new overheating incidents, which the company calls "minor."
The ministry responded, calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Maria at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Crisis Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage, seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages were released, and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and young people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced a young woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital of Auckland in 1959.
Working in the hospital, Liggins began to research premature delivery during his free time.
His research showed that the administration of hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Even colleagues, fighters, paid homage to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extremity. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as me... perhaps even more... I love her and I miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 80 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share this viewpoint, desiring that Queen Elizabeth II be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29 percent of those asked believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia will never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay races at the Community Games, but due to his complaints, his ability was doubted.
He was unable to use the remedies needed to endure his pain, because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Some people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, up to the early days of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could potentially be a source of water supply for Earth, and also of organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political nonsense and foolishness."
He will probably try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to older terrestrial radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and to provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation is operating, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley; neither parking lots nor park-and-ride options are available at the location.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would be played forcibly behind closed doors, without team support.
Published on Wednesday in the magazine Science, a study reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Explorers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process likely took longer due to hybridization between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortens, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Orations can be formed in the most diverse ways. They can be flattened into very thin forms.
It can be drawn to obtain a thin sheet, which can be folded and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled flat into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using beet juice.
Brassica juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, dry hands, press them into a ball shape.
A dryness on your hands will react with the external veins, which will make you feel strange and form as if a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water-spouting toilets in almost every house, connected to a complex network of drains.
Remnants of a water channel system were found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Necessities also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, restrooms were often part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
A giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing enabled by the wheel is the provision of much easier and faster transportation.
Because we have a train, a car, and many other vehicles.
Below them are larger cats that eat medium-sized prey in the scale of rabbits up to antelopes and deer.
Fine, there are many small cats (including stray house cats) that eat much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, specialization that each cat holds, which means they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in groups called prides.
A Gregon consists of one to three similar adult males and many to thirty females and children.
The swans are usually in close kinship with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion-like wolves function quite similarly to wolves or dogs of wolves that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of harsh, clamorous words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They can catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by scent, following the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) splits off from the main population from which it originates (as if they were crossing a mountain or river, or as if they were migrating to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one where they were previously.
That new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population must, in order to be a strong competitor, have other traits or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less similar to the other population.
Fine, with the passage of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are vegetables. Animals could not survive without vegetables.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 acrid teeth, along with an extra set in its palate, which meant that nothing that encountered it could escape.
It's not certain, but it may be that it had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would be helpless against it.
Although we may recognize most of their food, the Romans certainly had their own set of strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a gliro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on stools, rich men enjoyed having feasts together, where they would recline on their sides, eating their platters.
Amidst the ruins of Ancient Rome, there could not have been foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted maple syrup.
Babylonians built a chief temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests strove to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Imposing, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The largest part of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the fresh air.
Women were cooking in the yard; shops were simply open tables facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norwegian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and on his way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But independently of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence was the text: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence, the large parchment document (its dimensions are 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
It's likely the note was added simply as a label.
The offensives of Day D and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichy." These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, related to the Latin *civis*, citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and this somehow defines the dimension of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture encompasses the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuing cultural impetus, and a sufficiently large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with a congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
At the Congress, there was no power to collect taxes, and since there was no national executive or justice system, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to the state authorities, which were often uncooperative.
It also was not entitled to override tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles stipulated unanimous consent of all states before any change, and the states related to the central government so readily that their representatives often absent themselves.
The Italian national football team, and also the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the assembly/grouping of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European mariners briefly recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the indigenous methods of grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern border areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking still pictures is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the close of the era of analog film.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its proportion was inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 34mm tall.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (like the APS format, for example) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The much-criticized and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, became the object of critical scrutiny.
Over more than a thousand years, Christianity connected European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-penetrating power touched everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's financial resources exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this doctrine was obeyed.
Soon after the outbreak of battle, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness; it severely disrupted vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Because that tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1910s, the dominant sentiment among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid a return to such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States having four cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of depicting different time periods; each era in China, or each family that ruled, was a distinct dynasty.
Also among all dynasties was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those periods, furious battles occurred between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the soldiers, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they now are based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class in other countries to spark their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things beyond everyday life. He frequented a cave, which became known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated at the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is absolutely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easily found, even if one knows that it exists. When one is in the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples, many were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-pointing arch" mark looks like a V, and the "down-pointing arch" mark looks like a clamp or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you must start at the tip and push the arch, and down means you must start at the heel (this is where your hand holds the arch) and pull the arch.
A bow drawn upwards typically produces a more delicate sound, while a bow drawn downwards is louder and firmer.
Don't hesitate to add your own marks with a crayon, but remember that the printed publisher's marks are there for musical reasons, so they are usually observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Her Majesty Elizabeth the 6th, were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They drove to Paris in a car, surrounded by a crowd, shouting and crying threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen widely open the car windows.
At some point, a lover swung the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the intimidated queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of Filipinos were repaid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to reimburse a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits extracted from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped found the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed it, which ends, by agreement, around 1500.
Technologically determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology itself largely follows a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology inherently has "consequences" for societies that are essentially its own, and not socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide narrow-gauge railway is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new minimally invasive techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, embraced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and with the passage of time customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and those that were more harmonious with the location of society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the twelfth century, its status deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at that time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture in the East greatly influenced clothing.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles in the West could lag by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major achievements of the period was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food for the needs of only the cultivator and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved, local seeds for the bioregion, with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar viewpoints who feel alienated from social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The factors determining a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture adherents often signal their membership through a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, demeanor, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the regrettable cases of children who, during their upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or malicious abuse, were not socialized by adults.
Those children are called "wildened" or wild. Some wildened children were freed from people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of a child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wildened children may have endured severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in nature independently.
Raised only by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and must ask, suggest, and clarify procedures that might be difficult for the learner if they were to proceed independently.
Children find themselves in the care system for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, yet this happens.
We view the custodial system as a secure zone for those children.
Our care system must provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The curator must provide everything necessary that was lacking to them in the house from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet add extra dimensions to the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating factors when they explored public responses to websites.
The use of video recording followed significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is especially claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article "The President's Speech" indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain trauma can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even assumes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The research in the 20th century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of visible variation.
Separation and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans have to satisfy its needs for amino acids from available plants.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: a decline in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest-to-access sources of growth would be proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain essential amino acids.
Considering all circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentional awakening during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
You can easily do this, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to become aware without fully waking up.
If you notice that you are repeatedly looking at the clock while you're sleeping, it might be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms, drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed will make you get up to urinate.
The extent of inner peace a person has negatively correlates with the extent of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the power to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques from Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
In the center of Tibetan meditation lies the ten-fold game. Depicting various days, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates illuminated consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the push of systems, processes, and cultures caused the countries to diverge.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next 40 years and involved real battles, with proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize according to the Romanian bridgehead.
However, those plans dated back almost to a single night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The work of a navy traditionally was to ensure that your country retained the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving their people and goods.
Most notable among recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to halt that traffic.
If the allies were to fail, Germany would likely be able to conquer Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes developed them due to easy access to milk, wool, meat, and furs.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in flocks wandering on hills and other pastures, often tended by goatherds, who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Railways were being constructed in England since no earlier than the 16th century.
Although railways simply consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Spallows appeared early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it soon became clear that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
That became a popular practice, but iron caused a faster wear and tear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by walking; humans began to go upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization has been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus likely walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start relating more amicably to the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
That is like counter-symptomatic medication in many cases. However, if we want not only a temporary solution, we must find the causes of the problems and deactivate them.
Obviously, the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological achievements of humankind, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and an unsustainable way of life.
After the Congress accepted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Posters".
John Nixon conducted the first public reading of the document in the court of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent on July 6th to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 posters by Dunlap, of which it is known they exist, are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives now. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have claws with scales and nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two front claws, like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an opened medicine container or a toxic chemical substance.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "cimo" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both scavenging and parasitic behaviors are nesting, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women have double the likelihood of having MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child doesn't involve observing their own interests, or the interests of their child, best.
Such couples can choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During the adoption procedure, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not alone; experimentation, and experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, along with questioning and observation, guides scientific exploration.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's viewpoints on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek intellectual power declined, the West became evident to be estranged from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms that do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of repetitive autonomous operation even without external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the leading assumptions about DNA being the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Among examples of local activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and photograph and learn about orangutans there.
Every morning, people leave towns by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is in some way involved and contributing to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shaped the biosphere of one of its stable states, which has been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, one rarely hears a similar level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems continue to have these complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of distinct drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
It's regrettable that studying traffic flow is difficult, because one cannot predict the behavior of a driver with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a sufficiently uniform arrangement; thus, traffic flows strive to have a certain moderate uniformity and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, develop, and operate road installations.
Insects were the first animals to evolve flight. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
That gives them a wider selection of small hiding places against predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings forward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seemed prudent, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main river Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical skill of their construction.
The people of Egypt from the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about the basic chemical elements—like gold, silver, and copper—since ancient times, because these are found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he further theorized that they become new substances to form what we see.
Accommodation is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
One can also have allotropes, in whose composition there are small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unbelievably small that trillions of them could be squeezed into a point at the end of this sentence.
The chalk was a good tool for many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, due to the emergence of new methods of writing, the chalkboard has fallen into disfavor and disuse.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to get close to a quill pen.
One can only ask oneself what will become the key when something new comes.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus therefore releases a bit more of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a slight or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
Perhaps there are more seas on the nearby side, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to pour out onto the surface.
Explanatory theories focus on discovering what makes people act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized during the transition to adulthood.
These theories explore what is about certain people, what makes them desire the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular motivational theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behavioral patterns can emerge when administrators begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "one of the friends" (or female friends).
That type of administrator finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, assess work efficiency, assign tasks, and demand accountability from people.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team previously did and appropriate it for themselves.
Indeed, the leader was responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, such behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are fine differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as a point of contact for their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, because their teams may meet across different time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local managers.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team to which all members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to bypass the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for practically applying the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result of the process, when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle, it can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of clients.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation and also of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies Continuous Improvement as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the exploration of cognition. It thus broadens the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior motivates scientists to continue research.
It is a long-known fact that various types of brain defects, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
That provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong nuance of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Exploration in AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among them are control, planning, and enantiomorphism, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from a client, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Those things became distinct disciplines that focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs; they are also embodied in some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any education. Teachers often like to take their students to places unreachable by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art, sitting in their classroom.
To organize a virtual excursion is another great way to consider a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students of Bennet School in North Carolina produce a website about their trip to the state capital; a new version of the website appears each year, but the old versions remain accessible for use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing skills in learners. While learners often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because learners are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes learners more understanding of the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires learners to be wise and interested (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to online materials, learners can define their positions within the context of others' work and also outline their own viewpoints on certain problems (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders perceive as fundamentally Canadian.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
Here is a comparison of populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens in total.
The Islands of East Africa are located on the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, in relation to its fauna, it is an independent continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it took root deeply in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century when the explorer Vasco da Gama from Portugal initiated the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to carry a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Ladies, note that cultural differences can result in what might be considered flirtatious behavior, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and do not be afraid to refuse (it doesn't matter whether it's cultural or not, the difference isn't necessarily tolerable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerines as a strategic port named Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name White House, but they still left after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there and named it Casablanca.
Regarding the shopping scene, Casablanca is among the least interesting places in Morocco.
Around the old city center, it's easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets with its lava, mainly in the city center.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must inform themselves about each visit outside of it to be aware of the ongoing battles happening in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, in addition to the least expensive gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today Timbuktu is a impoverished city, but it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the red list of World Heritage sites due to the threatening sands from the desert.
It was one of the most important stops during the special program Wonders of the African World by PBS, made by Henry Louis Gates.
The city strongly contrasts with the other cities in the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs eastward along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocodile River.
The park encompasses 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecosystems, each supporting a different fauna.
It presents one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most symbolic of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, the park has daily conservation entrance permits.
It's also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry, either to the selected parks of South Africa, or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives that territory its name and it is the place that many tourists regard as the most interesting.
The line of buildings that creates the Hong Kong cityscape was compared to a bright histogram, which is evident due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross into the front that is located at the waterfront of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea off the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists appropriated for themselves, and therefore, if one seeks proof of the territory's colonial past, here is a suitable place to investigate.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) across the coastline into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just a mangrove swamp. In it are some of the last refuges of the magnificent jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water or swamps.
In 1966, Sundarbans became a reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
Buses run from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) all day, but most run between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, especially those traveling west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Because the interdistrict buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable vehicles for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a truss bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide, and it has two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The height of the structure under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
They plan for the bridge to fully reopen in September 2017, when, as planned, the Brazilian customs crossings will be completed.
The Guarani were the most remarkable indigenous group inhabiting that place, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as quasi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups, previously known as "The Great Province of Indies".
The Spanish began an era of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is very well known for its teams and players of polo being among the best in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the Polish fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Inquire at the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value has been pegged to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money is exchangeable at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Everywhere on the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, but British and US currency can be used; it's best to ask beforehand to find out which payment methods are accepted.
Because it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, exchange money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely becomes freezing, but wind and humidity combine, and therefore one feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals have become accustomed to the presence of people, they are still wild animals, and one should not feed or disturb them.
The park authorities request that you remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may appear, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all animals are capable of attacking.
Annually, dozens of visitors are injured because they are not maintaining a sufficient distance. Because these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, respect their space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, and therefore avoid bringing or cooking fragrant food and keep your campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and is home to just slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apio was founded in the 1850s and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the location of the infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Around 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggles for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three regions.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Haven district) are on the Pacific and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most have shade from palm trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at Waitemata Harbour in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are occasionally crowded family beaches where shops line the shore abundantly. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be more palatable.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easily available if you have concerns.
To Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. An espresso is a "short black," a cappuccino has a generous amount of cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to the standards of Belgium. Juices are expensive but delicious.
Throughout the year, many excursions take place to the reef, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and carefully heed safety warnings.
Crabs appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They may occasionally appear outside of that time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. The majority of sharks fear humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they will have accommodation upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book alternative accommodations through them, such as campsites.
Travel agents generally prepare plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the proposal or provide you with other documents for the intended destination (for example, a visa).
All changes or requests must still be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you must arrive early to get a good spot near the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there might be parts of the festival where it will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you navigate the northern Baltic Sea in winter, be careful about the location of the cabin, because going through ice causes a sufficiently terrifying noise in the most affected areas.
Pleasure cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on pleasure cruises are visa-free (check the conditions).
Casinos typically try to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests cheerful and to keep them around.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free, but intoxication impairs mental capacity, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Everyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice, or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a snowplow capable of blocking you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or rain, by condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the most outstanding thing for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used to mean a land voyage to observe the marvelous African fauna, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary people get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes appear timid, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called "camp walk," "march safari," or "hiking") consists of walking, whether for a few hours, whether for several days.
The Paralympics will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Hosting the games in 1964, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are likely in a complicated situation.
Nullification policies are diverse, but concerning late March, the majority of nullification policies based on coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, by which time the Olympics are planned.
It is expected that tickets for the majority of the events will cost between 2500 and 130,000 en, and that typical tickets will cost around 7000 en.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if one doesn't want to carry ironed smurfs, one might try using a dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the material doesn't overheat (which could shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause a burn mark on it).
There are different ways to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are required.
Filters have different efficiencies, and if you're concerned about that, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter wild animals that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can contaminate food, causing irritation or, worse, triggering allergic reactions, spreading toxins, or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals capable of wounding or killing humans with force are generally not considered plagues.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging grade conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing isolated wooded areas.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, be very careful: steep descents, narrow corridors, and winding bends are most abundant.
Warning speed limits are noticeably lower than those of the preceding and following sections – often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and they must be strictly obeyed, even more so than usual.
It is noteworthy that mobile phone service is still much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those from the neighbors to the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain apples throughout the year, cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pastries typically harmonize especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A delicacy is a food consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A substance can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, people commonly add yogurt to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, they commonly use coconut milk.
With 17,000 selectable islands, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term covering a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available everywhere in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy dishes, with flavors favored by Javanese people: peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Hinges on both sides of the saddle function as stirrup supports at the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present security problems because the rider's feet could potentially get caught in them.
If, while riding, one falls from a horse and their foot is caught by the stirrup, one could be dragged by the potentially running away horse. To minimize this risk, various safety measures can be taken.
First, the majority of riders carry saddles with a smooth, sufficiently narrow cantle and pommel.
Moreover, some saddles, mainly English saddles, have such safety straps that a falling rider can pull forward to unhook the stirrup leathers from the saddle.
Valle Cochamó: the most important place for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountaintops offer amazing views. Climbers from all parts of the world endlessly create new paths from the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one glides downhill on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are known as "skiing fanatics" and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is calculated as a sport from at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first pleasure ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called ski touring, ski trekking, or ski migration.
It relates to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but it usually doesn't imply them, as these latter occur on rugged terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think about its route as if it resembled a migration route.
In good conditions, you can cover distances somewhat greater than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of hiking without a heavy backpack on well-maintained paths.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, to travel through several countries, one needs to repeatedly fulfill visa requirements and undergo passport checks.
The Schengen Area still functions in this regard as if it were a single country.
Provided that one remains within this area, one can generally cross borders without needing to go through passport controls.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves you time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques. Some official agencies calculate goods older than 100 years as antiques.
Because the definition changes locally, in places like North America the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
One could consider antiques things like metiartajĵoj (handmade items), even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Buffalo farming is an important livelihood among them, and the culture surrounding that trade is also important for many other artisans.
Even in tradition, not all communities engaged in large-scale breeding of water buffalo, but they lived off fishing, hunting, or something similar, using the water buffalo mostly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many similar things work in modern jobs. Tourism offers important income to Sameujo, the same region.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Romani people, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and false ideas about Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued against the visited country, this may affect your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even though they are directed at their own citizens.
For example, US citizens in the Middle East might encounter situations different from those affecting Europeans or Arabs.
An alert is only a short summary of the political situation of a country.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and it consists of various types, which depend on the location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Gales, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms, and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable for travelers to be aware of the specific risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this can impact any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone must receive professional training.
Internet search for a course on hostile environments will most likely show the address of a local company.
The course will generally cover all the items presented here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
One course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include a role-play, a lot of sugar, and occasionally training on weapons.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wilderness, but there are few works on military zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness to issue passports without indicating gender (X) or outdated documents conforming to the desired name varies from government to government.
Whether receiving governments are willing to accept these documents varies greatly as well.
Screen searches in security checkpoints became also much more tedious in the period after September 11, 2001.
Non-surgical transgender people do not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity remaining untouched.
Surfing is the retreating flow of waves that have broken at the shore, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the underwater diverse formations, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, where rapid flow to depth can occur.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
And when one swims out of the current, returning swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to choose a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities or whether you've been noticed, perhaps you'd rather wait until you are rescued.
The rebound shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture often have a special difficulty readapting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you had already adapted to the new culture and lost some customs of your native culture.
When people first traveled abroad, they likely had patience and understanding, because they knew that travelers need to adapt to the new country.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed in relation to travelers returning home.
The pyramidal spectacle of sound and light is one of the most interesting things for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Here you will generally hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The meeting of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is placed on the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
The other ones are Livingston Island and Deception Island, whose flooded volcanic caldera, still active, provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
United with the plateau here, the mountain range of the peninsula reappears in the distance, forming the Ellsworth Mountains, which are 360 kilometers long and are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Vinson Point, is 4892 m high.
In remote locations with no access to a mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only means.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cell phone, because you have to be outdoors with a clear view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure crafts, as well as expeditions that require data and voice capabilities.
Your local phone service provider could provide you with more information about connecting to that service.
For those who plan a sabbatical year, it is increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary education, because it provides them with a free year before going to university, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a gap year course abroad, this can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you return to your home country.
Normally, there will be an enrollment fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes, one often needs a jacket.
Despite the fact that the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national passion in Finland: one in seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Your popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. But otherwise, it concerns a sufficiently unique statistic (e.g., in the Netherlands, one in forty people owns a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cargo ships also include a stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can fully use a few days to visit the historical city, returning by night to the ship to sleep there.
If you travel only by cruise ship, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, in Germany. As can be seen above on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience, regardless of age and background, especially if one has never flown before or has experienced a traumatic event.
That is not a shameful matter: it is no different from personal fears and aversions that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome fear that is based on not knowing or controlling things.
Courier companies receive good money for the rapid delivery of items. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some lines, larger companies have their own airplanes, but there was a problem in other lines and with smaller companies.
If they shipped goods by air freight, some routes might involve a few days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to accomplish that faster was to send things as registered packages. According to airline regulations, you cannot send a package without a related passenger, and here you seize the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a very large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it instead).
However, this is not cheap: according to a rough estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual savings rate for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth the effort to search for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there exists a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is recognized by no member state of the UN.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developing, and vibrant commercial center, situated on a large gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Amidst the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers, traditional roofs of red tiles, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches appear scattered, but the city's ethos is more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and on it stands an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth dedicating half an hour to a walk through the intriguing village.
North and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its grand merits.
Bus line 403 of Scotturb regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (sanctuary), which is the site of the world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a cemetery and also a place with almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women still remain who survived their passage here, and there are even more people who have loved ones who were killed or worked to death there, whether Jews or not.
Please behave in this place with as much dignity, solemnity, and respect as it entirely deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the location with markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most posters are only in Catalan, because the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the subway, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris have acquired a reputation for being egocentric, unfriendly, and proud people.
This is often just a vague stereotype, but the best way to maintain smooth relations with Parisians is to behave as if you were "bien élevé" (well-bred). This greatly facilitates your trip.
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly disappear if one shows basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beech, fir, and spruce, and it features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of plant communities is remarkably high due to the range of microclimates, diverse terrains, and varying altitudes.
The region is also home to extremely diverse animals and bird species.
There, one can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and wolverines, in addition to many more common species.
During a visit to the monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide sanitary supplies to women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own sanitary supplies, especially if they are light-colored.
Similarly, men must wear knee-length trousers.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but they don't wash those clothes after each use, and therefore you might not feel comfortable if you wear these skirts. It's one size for all men!
Majorca's cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular evening meal, especially in summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available addition, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word "Sie" (meaning you), is always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs and objects.
Probably it also makes reading easier, but writing becomes a bit more complicated because you need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in its substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in the Italian language, because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters c and g are primarily noteworthy because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Furthermore, one must pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means chariot.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
Therefore, the legacy of this grammatical introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It is unnecessary to say that if one speaks a Romance language, this will make learning Portuguese easier.
However, people who speak Spanish a little can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it's not worth learning separately.
Generally, pre-modern observatories are now outdated and remain as museums or educational facilities.
Because at that time light pollution wasn't the problem it is today, they generally located themselves in cities or at universities, places more easily accessible than those where constructions were built in modern times.
The most modern exploration telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were arranged by the emperor only for himself and for other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look best in their natural environment, don't give in to the temptation to remove specimens, even "just one."
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in your immediate expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe and very easy place to explore. Upon arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
However, since you will be in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to battle the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
In addition, there are a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the patriarchs from the Bible: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure whether the bus you want to use goes to Hebron and not only to the adjacent Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Domestic waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation on.
Thus, it would be possible, for example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or to travel by river cruise ship to interesting cities on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also optimize routes on known roads for migration and cycling.
Christmas is among the most important holidays of Christianity. It celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Disbelievers living in Christian countries or elsewhere throughout the world have adopted many of the traditions regarding this holiday.
Traditionally, people spend Easter night sleepless in an outdoor location to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations for this tradition, but it could also be an ante-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
On the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil, and the parishes celebrate right at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived at the island came either by swimming, by flying, or by floating.
Due to the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, which is when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the boreal aurora, because the sky will be dark almost always.
You can also enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners might be accustomed.
Costumes are the normal work attire, and colleagues address each other by family names or job titles.
Labor harmony is most important, just as emphasizing group striving rather than praising individual achievements.
Laborists typically have to get their superiors' approval for all decisions made, and they must obey instructions without question.
