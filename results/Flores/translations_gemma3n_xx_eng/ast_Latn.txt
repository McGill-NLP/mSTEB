This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread; moreover, it also provides details not found in the fossils, such as color and three-dimensional distribution.
Scientists believe that the plumage of this animal was dark brown on top and carotenoid underneath.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur doesn't have a fully developed spine or vertebral column, but does have other characteristics such as downy and feathery bristles, researchers concluded that it is likely the spine developed after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, even if this is from a young dinosaur, the sample is of adult plumage and not from a juvenile.
Scientists suggest that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observations that were made in the galaxy of Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by the force of the tide between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the earth, causing the tides, the Camino de Santiago exerts force in the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter orbits the galaxy in a halo, and is composed of abundant particles.

Four skiers in the women's slopestyle ski jumping group were unable to finish the races, and 45 of the total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom were unable to qualify for the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy General Inspector D. K. Arya said: "Let's arrest five people responsible for the rape of the Swiss woman and recover her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
The house was also occupied by three people when the car crashed, and they didn't sustain any damage.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the Audi TT.
He was immediately hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeboya was accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
Under pending custody and charges and trial, but any eyewitness will come under suspicion due to the public dissemination of their image.
It is a common practice to assist in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works in a very distinct way and the courts saw the surfacing of similarities as something potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee warns that "journalists may be playing a game if they publish photos and information of the suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the prosecution, told journalists that they would not be making any comments on the matter, at least until the charges are presented.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to settle according to the boundaries that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other matters discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has maintained a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years since signing the agreement, while the Palestinians agree to allow that presence for only five years.
The shooters of the supplementary pest control program had to be closely supervised by the guards, while the program was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The joint entity NPWS and the Australian SportShooters Association (NSW) Inc. selected qualified volunteers within the sport shooters association's hunting program.
In coordination with Mick O'Flynn, interim Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected snipers received complete training in safety and training.
Martelly was appointed to the position in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
Martelly's fifth postal code is in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a set of measures aimed at taking the country to new elections.
The commission was the response that Martelly gave to the thousands of protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, at times violent, led to the inability to organize elections, which were supposed to be held in 2011.
It was reported that around 60 cases of iPod malfunction due to overheating occurred, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been sent 27 cases of accidents involving the devices.
A week ago, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that Apple would report 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling Apple's report postponement "really regrettable."
The earthquake partially trapped Mariana at 7:19 local time (9:10 p.m. Friday GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said that no damage had been reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A Filipino retired police officer rescued several tourists from Hong Kong who were held hostage after their bus was seized in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Foreigners rescued the people being held, and there are at least six confirmed victims.
He freed six hostages, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then occupied the place of an elderly woman while she was going to the washbasin. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital of Auckland in 1959.
When he/she was working at the Liggins Hospital, he/she started to investigate premature birth in his/her free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation could be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" recorders from the flight on Wednesday.
Their fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the West. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Truly unique like her. A very strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as strange as I am... perhaps even more so... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have grown by eight percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the people in the survey share this point of view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II of England to be the last monarch of Australia.
As per the survey results, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never have been one.
The Olympic gold medalist was going to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He couldn't take the necessary medicine to overcome the pain because they are prohibited at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number on January 25th.
Numerous people verified the discovery with advanced hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water brought to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins that support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the start of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he/she/it will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Agency says would allow aircraft to make shorter flights, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology instead of old technology based on ground radar technology. With this, I want to allow air traffic controllers to establish the position of aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no extraordinary transport, and the surface trains do not appear in Wembley, and long-term and short-term parking are not available on the surface.
The lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the presence of the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the discovery of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer, due to the interbreeding between Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
The dough can be given many forms. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
It can be made into thin wire, to handle and braid it. It can also be forged or made into plates with it.
It can be made very thin and inlaid into another metal. It can become so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the miniatures of some books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage extract.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder together, and then, with clean and damp hands, press it into a ball shape.
The humidity of your hands will react with the outer layers. You will feel it a bit strange as it forms a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had latrines with cisterns in practically every house, rivaling an advanced sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were often part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in the same company.
When you call someone who is miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere alters part of the light and vision.
It is necessary to have a 100-foot tall rocket to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the invention did for us was to make transportation easier and faster.
Bring us the train, the car, and many other forms of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including common cats) that eat the smallest prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
Male groups consist of one to three related males together with up to thirty females and pups.
Women are often related to each other, forming a large family of daughters and sisters.
The manes of lions function in a similar way to those of wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions a lot (although not other large cats) in their behavior and are also very harmful to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete: it can do backflips (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and exert five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's growl isn't like the powerful roar of a lion; it's like a phrase of rumbling, raspy words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots sniff out and hunt animals for food using their sense of smell, following their scent trails in the ground.
They can see well in darkness with night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with their surroundings and pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the original population (if they leave to live in the mountains or the river, or move to an island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an extreme environment that they previously did not have.
This new environment has extreme resources and competitors, so the population will need distinct characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed a bit; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapted to its new environment, they began to resemble each subsequent population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so distinct that they will not be able to be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable and important consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is to say, that they let out).
Plants make their food by photosynthesizing sunlight. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
Their large canines have more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, with a special game in the sky of the mouth, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses their path.
We aren't entirely sure, but it might have a split tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
He would attack anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was a match for him.
While most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had a good share of strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a wood mouse.
Another difference is that while the men try and the women eat sitting on stools, the rich men have feasts together where they lie on their sides while they eat.
The ancient Roman diets could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa. And no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a principal temple which was considered as the house of the god.
The people made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests attended to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and within it an inner sanctuary that only priests may enter.
Ziggurats, special pyramid-shaped towers, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
A large part of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were showcases facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large fir trees in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that they exiled Eric the Red from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, he stumbled upon Greenland and named it as such.
But without taking this discovery into account, the Eskimo tribes already lived there in those days.
Even though the countries are considered "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
In the back of the Declaration of Independence it was written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the end of the document, at the bottom of the page.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning, the parchment (29.75 by 24.50 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Indeed, it's probable that the notation will only be added as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was governed by the Vichy side, which were the French who made alliances with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and French forces would liberate southern France and head towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a representative group of people who live and work in a certain area, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, relates to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and which, in a way, defines the greatness of society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture implies passing knowledge down through many generations, a cultural wave that is maintained and an important spread.
Minority cultures are sometimes denigrated to the point of not allowing their historically relevant examples to be recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – the Congress as the sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it depended on the state authorities, who did not usually cooperate, to approve all laws.
He/She/It also did not have the authority to annul tax legislation or interstate tariffs.
The Articles require the unanimous consent of all states before they can be amended, and the states take the central government so little into account that representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and was the winner of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Of the groups of islands that the country has, Japan is, geographically speaking, an archipelago.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1627, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the grain production practices of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coasts of Taiwan; they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they were originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common image photography format in the world is 35 mm., which was the dominant size of film at the end of the era of analog film.
It is still produced nowadays, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The format of 35mm has, paradoxically, 36mm of width and 24mm of height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to obtain the ratio of the simplest whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (from the APS family, for example) have an equal or very similar proportion.
The rule of thirds, so often scoffed at and sometimes ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
He/She states that the most effective place for the main theme is the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and gained power, was subject to scrutiny.
Christianity united different European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
The overwhelming power affects all levels of society, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that riches should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led to questioning whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the mooring began, Great Britain initiated the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted and ratified international law by several international agreements of the two preceding centuries.
The United Kingdom is attempting to establish mining operations in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the answer to this tactic was proven, Germany was expecting a response similar to its submarine war without concealment.
In the 1920s, the most widespread attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States of America with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the chief from his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing extreme periods of time; each era of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, each dynasty had an unstable rule of divided provinces. The best-known period of them is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were fierce wars between nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat of the grand palace of Xi'an.
It spawned numerous social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to its people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, following the Revolution, positions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and well-off to succeed.
The same happens with the army because instead of basing military classifications on class, they are currently based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in the questions of earthly life. He used to go to a cave that he began to know as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
High up in one of the mountains north of La Meca lies this cave, isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's not easy to find for nothing, even knowing of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are in total isolation.
One cannot see anything more beautiful than the lovely and clear sky and the mountains that surround it. Few things from this world enter this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramidal constructions made in memory of the deceased pharaoh.
The Xiza plateau, or the “Necropolis of Xiza,” situated in the valley of the dead Egyptians, includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to pay homage to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples to pay homage to his wives and relatives.
The indication of "arcu p'arriba" resembles a V, and the indication of "arcu pa baxo" resembles a staple or a square without the bottom line.
Up means you have to draw the string back and pull the bow, and down means you have to draw on the grip (that's where your hand is on the bow) and pull the bowstring.
An upper arch produces a softer sound, while a lower one is louder and more assertive.
You can take notes, but remember that the printed musical markings are there for musical reasons and should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Marie Antoinette of France, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of working women from the market.
In a cart, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people wailing and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw wide the windows of their carriage.
At that moment, a member of the crowd held up the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the United States' imperialism in the Philippine-American War were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
From now on, the super-benefits derived from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos were the main gains of the United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that caused the creation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Late Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a broad set of ideas, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense in which human destiny is dominated by a underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a long path independent of political or cultural influence, and that technology, for its part, has effects on societies that are inherent in that it is socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily facilitates the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable with only a handful of cars, so new methods of production must be developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The possession of a large quantity of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair the damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a lot of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures arose linked to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is seen as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The fame of being a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was then that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style emerged between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing of the North was not much influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by another 25 or 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own distinct style. One of the greatest advances of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is what is done to have abundant production in order to cover the needs of the farmer or the farming woman and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often ecologically sound system that uses seeds from the ecoregion along with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers developed subsistence agriculture, and this is what happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures group individuals who feel rejected by societal standards and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine that a culture is distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their belonging through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes clothing, gestures, and slang.
One of the most common methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point to the few and unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not socialized with adults while they were growing up.
These children may be called "wild" or "savage." Some were exiled (generally, their own relatives); in some cases, this abandonment of children is due to the refuge of parents from a severe physical or mental disability.
Vulnerable children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is supposed that some were raised by animals; others say they lived alone in the wild nature.
When children are raised entirely by non-human animals, young children tend to exhibit (within physical limits) almost identical behaviors to those animals who cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a support that provides assistance to individuals who are going through a learning experience, such as using new computer software or undertaking a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding integrates into the software and has the objective of questioning, reminding, and explaining procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are going to shelters for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even coercion.
No child would thrive in an environment lacking care, education, and affection, but they do.
We believe that the Family Support service is a safe environment for these children.
Our welcoming system provides safe housing, caring caregivers, regular education, and quality healthcare.
It is assumed that the shelters take all the measures that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of interpersonal communication and mass communication.
The particularities of the internet appeal to additional dimensions beyond that encompassed by the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "to disconnect" and "to socialize" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and relationships with continuity were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, make sure that no one can detect if someone is lying through the interpretation of subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are, on the other hand, capable of evaluating sincerity with precision.
He suggests that these skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century showed that there are two genetic reserves: traditional and expressive.
Mutation is a friendly genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination generate variation between two genetic reserves with each generation.
There, on the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Mom, please don't do it; there are serious consequences: it increases depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources to find would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
Along with the hillside, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides proteins that contain essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do nowadays.
The interruption of dreaming is the process of voluntarily waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved using a not-too-loud alarm that wakes you up without fully waking you.
If you find yourself turning off the clock while you're sleeping, you can put it in the other end of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a famous diuretic) before bed, forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force is. Each person has the capacity to achieve complete peace and joy.
The whole world can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us from it is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and with many techniques of Indian yoga.
Primarily, Tibetan Buddhism is characterized by it. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love and compassion.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the goddess Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and conscious illumination is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to the USSR and the United States of America cooperating. With the war ending, the confrontations between the systems, processes, and culture led to a distancing between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would finally be freed truly by means of subsidiary armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed; the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using boats for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The armed forces are tasked with guaranteeing that your country maintains its capacity to move citizens and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's capacity to move population and goods.
One of the most notable nearby examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The United States were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
In those times, the German navy, making extensive use of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies fail, it is probable that Germany will conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the mountains of Zargos, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate animals to have easy access to milk, land, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, and they were tended by shepherds, who were often children or young men, resembling more the familiar shepherds. These care methods are still used today.
The first roads were built in England in the 16th century.
Even the wagonways were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, allowing the horses that pulled them to gain more speed and pull heavier loads than on roads, a bit rougher, than the roads of the time.
The mischievous ones quickly got inside to endure the slopes. Little by little, however, they realized that the slopes must be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a normal practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first means of transport known is walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which literally means upright man).
Australopithecus, our ancestors, didn't walk upright so often.
The specialization in bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it seems Sahelanthropus already walked upright seven million years ago.
We can start living a more friendly way to the environment, we can join the ecological movement, and we can be activists to lessen future suffering to some degree.
It's usually treated symptomatically. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we'll need to find the root cause of the problems and deactivate it.
There's quite a bit of noise about how the world has changed drastically due to the advances in science and technology of humanity; problems only seem to grow because of overpopulation and a wasteful lifestyle.
After being adopted by the Congress on June 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing house of John Dunlap.
At night, they made between 150 and 200 copies, which are now known as the "Dunlap Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on June 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 images that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and breathe.
There are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and spurs, they lay eggs, and their hind legs move like those of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers today process information encoded in a binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
The internal inflammation may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to allow for an early diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals.
Read the label to get specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bichu" is used by entomologists in a non-formal way to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with lice, which are insects adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and reduviid bugs are pests, adapting to live in the nest or home of those who harbor them.
The United States of America has approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research shows that women have twice the likelihood of developing EM compared to men.
A couple can decide that raising a child isn't what's best for them or what's best for them.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In every adoption, the biological parents lose their parental rights so that another couple can have them over the girl.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by conducting tests, observations, and guiding scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were considered in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many saw that the rhythms in psychology and behavior depend greatly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their manifestation in internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, are documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in a free cycle period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was conclusive in determining that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage DNA well with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material fragment, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are heritable, while other types of mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the objective of enjoying the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Some examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks to study information about their ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and encounter people who work in the place they have just left.
This dynamic transport shuttle connects the whole world and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now indicates that this coal-intensive economy displaced the biosphere of one of the stable states that facilitated human evolution in the last two million years.
People participate in society and use modes of transportation. Almost everyone complains about those modes of transportation.
In developed countries, you almost never encounter the same level of complaint about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they do it daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
The study of traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to exhibit reasonably uniform behavior; however, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be represented, approximately, mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design, and implement the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly served them to escape enemies more easily and find food and reproduce greedily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows us to hide from predators in a greater number of small places.
Nowadays, the only creatures that cannot wound the wings are the devil's horses and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the sun.
Two people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems to me that this is what the senses perceive, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the flow of the second longest river.
The Amazones is considered the widest river in the world because in some points it reaches 6 miles.
Twenty percent of the water that reaches the oceans comes from the rivers of the planet, mainly from the Amazon.
The Amazon River measures 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, never surpassing the size or the artistic excellence of the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and communication.
Italian is the usual language of most state workers, while Latin is also used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the City of Vatican City are Catholic.
Basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper have been known since antiquity, and all of them can be found in nature in the form of native metal, being easily extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that all things are made from mixtures of one or more elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was rather like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into nine substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are composed of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the space that closes this sentence.
Thus, the invention of the pencil greatly facilitated the lives of many people.
Sadly, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, so they don't have to touch a single tool.
Only one can guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb uses the principle that it takes energy to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Separating the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no energy.
The surface of the Moon is composed of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The continental shelf is about 70 km thick on the closest side and 100 km thick on the furthest side.
You are more delicate in the seas and greater in the high lands.
Perhaps there are more mussels on the near side because the seabed is thinner. It was easier for the waves to reach the surface.
Theories of content should focus on finding out what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what there is in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors emerge from what managers attempt to direct towards their former colleagues. One extreme is to continue being "one of them" (or them).
This type of boss struggles by making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning tasks, and ensuring people take responsibility.
On the other extreme of the spectrum, a mute individual emerges who ensures that everything the team did must be changed and made their own.
After all, the leader is the last one responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes breakdowns between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups have the same standards of excellence as conventional ones, but there are slight differences.
The members of the virtual team often function as the direct point of contact for their physical group.
With having more autonomy than conventional team members, as they can meet according to different time zones, something that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of an "invisible team" of truth (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for its members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One of the methods to introduce learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively throughout the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle by an organization can lead towards a new innovative process that meets the needs of the client.
Before the organization can innovate, the leadership must foster a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous perspective as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data show physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the research of cognition. Consequently, the area of research becomes smaller and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior hinders scientists in their research.
It has been known for some time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect our behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that were never before observed.
We are gathering a lot of information and material to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even though AI sounds like something from science fiction, it's an important part of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Artificial Intelligence research enables machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to the client's diagnoses and requirements, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices, and faces.
Talos have evolved into separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and it has been built for the benefit of personal computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any class. Moreover, the teacher would take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual excursions. Students can see museum objects, visit an aquarium, or interact with works of art while they are in the classroom.
Sharing a hike is also a personal way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future groups.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the Capital City; they remodel the previous one, but they keep the versions so they can serve as templates.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students start a blog with careless grammar and spelling, the pressure of the audience often changes this.
Since the students are a very critical audience, the blog writer strives to improve the writing to avoid those criticisms.
Participating in a blog also "helps students gain greater knowledge of the world around them." The need to pique public interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is an activity that stimulates collaboration and motivates students to learn outside of school.
The good use of blogs "motivates students to critical analysis; through active exposure to content on the internet, students define their opinions with the texts of other people and form their stance on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the Canadian capital of charm and bilingualism, with a number of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls, and the north shelters the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region and its surroundings.
That and more is what makes Ontario the basic Canadian experience for tourists.
There are large areas in the north with low population, and these are practically uninhabited lands of wild nature.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Eastern Islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island from afar, and a continent in itself when it comes to animal life.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury and beach tourism centers.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, with a special focus on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the sea route to India from Europe.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that women say they are married, without taking into account their marital status.
It helps a lot to wear a ring (even if it's not one that looks very expensive).
Women have realized that cultural differences can lead them to consider it improper, and it is not uncommon for them to follow us, holding our arm, etc.
Be firm when welcoming men, and do not hesitate to defend their position (even with differing cultural views, it is not permissible).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, before abandoning it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants strengthened its foundations and gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old town it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of trinkets, all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the eastern part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, to make any visit outside of Goma, you need to find out about the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base to ascend Mount Nyiragongo, in addition to being one of the cheapest places in all of Africa to go on excursions to see mountain gorillas.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combining with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Nowadays, Tombouctou is an improvised city, although its reputation makes it a tourist city. It has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the most important passages by Henry Louis Gates in the special "Wonders of the African Word" on PBS.
The city has a stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab feel than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, and follows the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a very diverse type of life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Regarding the five national parks of South Africa, they have conservation and park access rates.
It could be a good deal to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists see as the main attraction.
The row of buildings that make up the urban landscape of Hong Kong can be compared to a bright bar chart, aided by the presence of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island to go to Kowloon's waterfront promenade, which is right across.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is located on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose as their own, so if you're looking for traces of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, which extends 80 km (50 mi) into the inland territories of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The mangrove area in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Indeed, the oaks are not mangrove type, but they retain remnants of the magnificent jungles that covered the plains of the Ganxes.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third corresponds to aquatic or swampy zones.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary; nowadays, the area has about 400 Bengal tigers and around 40,000 chital deer.
The buses leave from the intermodal station (on the other side of the river) during the day, probably most of them, especially those going to the east or to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses between districts are often full, it's advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy, serve all the districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and affordable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the Pontevedra bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco sheltered other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born as "the giant province of the Indies" as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best volleyball teams and players in the world.
The biggest annual competition takes place in December at the Las Cañitas ice rink.
Here you can find more modest tournaments or matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for volleyball matches, consult the Argentine Volleyball Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the Isles Bank, in the locality of Stanley (opposite the FIC West store).
Sterling banknotes are generally accepted on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
On remote islands, it's easy for credit cards not to be accepted, although the British or US currency might be. Check with the owners beforehand to find out what payment method is accepted.
It's practically impossible to exchange currency in the Falkland Islands, so exchange money before you leave.
You know that Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; the summer months typically have temperatures above 30ºC.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the air and stillness combined make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There isn't a particularly "rainy" or "dry" season: rain is present practically all year round.
Also, many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans; the animals are tame and you should not bother them or feed them.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Despite appearing very docile, bison, elk, bears, and other large animals can attack.
Every year, there are many visitors injured because they don't stay at a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you must respect their space.
Please be aware that sweet smells attract bears and other animals; it's best to avoid carrying or cooking sugary foods and leave the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The cove was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven German, British, and United States ships refused to abandon it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the chief Tupua Tamamese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, near Auckland between two bays. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean; they stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all are safe sand coves, and most have areas with pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
The sand dunes of Tamaki Drive are in the Port of Waitemata, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually houses clustered together with a variety of shops on the waterfront. It's safe to walk.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't complex but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta."
There are numerous French wines to taste, but those from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The water from the tap in the area can be drunk safely, but bottled water is easily found if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" is quite new. A single coffee is just an "espresso," a cappuccino comes with cream on top (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The chocolate is as good as the Belgian's. The jam is expensive but excellent.
They travel to the coral reef all year round, and injuries caused by these things there are rare.
Anyway, follow the recommendations, respect the signs, and take all necessary safety precautions.
The comb jellyfish appear near the beaches and rivers from October to April in northern 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these dates.
Sharks exist, although it's rare for them to attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and will swim away if they see them.
Sea turtles no longer live in the sea today. Their primary habitat is the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation with an advance gives the traveler peace of mind, and this way they have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible to find other ways to find accommodation such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include lunch, transportation to the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also cancel the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any change or request must be managed with the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
For the festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp, and for many it's an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stages, you have to go ahead and camp to hear the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music ends on the main stages, there will be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until very late at night.
There are festival grounds with campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, look where the cabin is: if you sail with ice, there is a lot of noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. For cruise passengers, a visa is not required (see terms and conditions).
Casinos strive to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are usually no clocks or windows, and exits are difficult to find.
Generally, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and comfortable in the facilities.
Both cases of drinking alcoholic beverages for free. However, being drunk is being out of your mind, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or in mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, the grip is low and you can't steer as if you had bare asphalt.
The strong winds can bring snow quickly enough to block things up in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow, blizzards, or ice condensation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the cold and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a significant experience for visitors.
The popular term "safari" is used to talk about land trips to observe the gorgeous African fauna, especially that of the savanna.
Those animals, like elephants and giraffes, often crash into cars and the standard equipment allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be cowardly, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "safari walk", "hiking safari", or "trek") consists of walking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games were held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before they were postponed, you might be in a complicated situation.
Policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus cancellations do not cover June 2020, the dates of the Games.
It is estimated that most entries will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with an average price of 7,000 ¥.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have irons or if you don't want to have to iron even your socks, you can try using a hairdryer (if you have one).
Be careful that the meadows don't reach high temperatures (which can cause them to dry out or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to filter water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases they are not accustomed to in their countries of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, even worse, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force, are generally not considered plagues.
Buying books in those stores is the way to purchase goods exempt from direct and indirect taxes in some places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The tour operator Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes passing through isolated and snowy terrain.
If you aren't used to driving on rural roads, you need to be careful: there are steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The speed limits of the signs are considerably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections —normally 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h—and it is very important to stay within them.
Strangely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apple as an ingredient all year round and cabbage and plums appearing in the summer.
Many of the German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes usually go well with a strong cup of coffee.
