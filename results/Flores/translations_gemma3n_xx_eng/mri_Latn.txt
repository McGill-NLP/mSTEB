It's unclear whether these are days, months, or something else. * **"Rū whenua":** This term is a bit ambiguous without more context. It could refer to a land tremor, earthquake, or some other geological event. * **"I te wā o reira":** This means "at that time". * **"i te GMT i te Paraire":** This indicates the time zone (GMT) and day of the week (Monday). **To provide an accurate translation, I would need more information about what "rū whenua" refers to and the intended date format.** However, if we assume "07.19" and "09.19" are months of the year (July and September), and "te wā o reira" refers to the time of the event, we might attempt a very loose translation as: "There was an earthquake in Mariana in July 2019 in the morning, at that time (September 2019 at GMT on Monday)." **Please provide more context for a more accurate and meaningful translation.**

The journey of learning is a significant part of it. Sometimes the teacher really needs to take their students to places that cannot be reached by road.
The path of the digital world is the management of connected journeys. Students are discovering treasure archives, traveling to explore the ocean's source, and enhancing the artistic skills of those living in the community.
A good way to start a trip together is to discuss thoughts about the journey and talk about experiences related to the upcoming classes.
