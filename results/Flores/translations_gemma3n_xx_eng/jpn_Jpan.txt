This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also conveys detailed aspects not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal are chestnut-colored on the outside and warm-toned on the inside.
This discovery also served as a clue for exploring the evolution of bird feathers.
Although dinosaur feathers lacked a fully developed rachis, a central shaft characteristic of other feathers, the presence of down and filament-like structures suggests that researchers hypothesize the rachis evolved later than these other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it is inferred that they were used not for flight, but for thermoregulation and visual effects. Researchers suggest that despite the specimen being a young dinosaur's tail, the feathers resemble adult feathers and are not those of a chick.
Researchers suggest that this specimen, despite being a young dinosaur's tail, has adult feathers rather than down feathers.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

The frustration within this community is leading to current efforts to draft policies regarding sexual content on sites that host millions of open-license media.
The content was mostly theoretical, but the written program simulated observations conducted in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
The effect this team was seeking was likely the result of tidal forces acting between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon's gravity causes the tides on Earth, the Milky Way exerts its influence on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding galaxies is said to be arranged like a halo around the galaxy and composed of many small particles.

Looking at the infrared image, it appears likely that it is a cave due to the temperature difference between day and night.
It is cooler than the surrounding surfaces during the day, and warms up at night.
"While such thermal behavior is often less stable than a large cave on Earth that can maintain a relatively constant temperature, there is agreement in the fact that deep holes form in the ground," says Dr. Glenn Cushing of the USGS Astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted using outdated equipment. Voters are isolated in booths and place a pre-printed ballot indicating the candidates into an envelope.
Voters, after verifying their identity with a staff member, deposit their ballot in the ballot box and sign the voter registry.

Candidates may designate a representative to be present at any part of the procedure. In the evening, the ballots will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Mr. Fune and Mr. Price are scheduled to appear in Westminster Superior Court on February 16th.
The deceased were Nicholas Alden (25) and the driver Zachary Cadback (21).
Edgar Begira sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider suffered severe injuries requiring facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon failed when aimed at the fifth man's head. Schneider is in pain, has lost sight in one eye, has a portion of his skull missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
After Wednesday's event,カルパネド competed in two individual races at the championship. (Note: I've kept "カルパネド" as is, assuming it's a proper noun - a name.)
The first race was a slalom, but she retired on her first run (DNF). In this race, 36 out of 116 competitors ended up with the same result.
In the Giant Slalom, the next race, she finished in 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, 2 minutes 11.60 seconds behind the winner, Claudia Rohrer of Austria, and 1 minute 9.02 seconds behind Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary, finishing 10th in the women's sitting group.
In the women's sitting skiing group, four skiers were unable to finish their runs, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 competitors failed to rank.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Police Deputy Inspector D.K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people for the rape of a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendant appeared in court with their face covered.
Three people were in the house when the cars collided, but no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed to traffic while paramedics rescued the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr. Adecco subsequently appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on suspicion of murdering his son.
Although she is detained pending trial and indictment, the widespread release of her photograph could compromise witness evidence.
This is generally done in other regions of the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the courts view the publication of photographs as potentially detrimental.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at Dandy University, pointed out that "reporters who publish photos of suspects, etc., are treading a dangerous path."
The King's Court Criminal Department, which is in charge of the prosecution comprehensively, has indicated to the press that it will not comment further until at least an indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document refers to a border dispute, and Palestine's aspiration is based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
It is reported that other topics being addressed include the future state of Jerusalem, a holy place for both countries, and issues concerning the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding to continue its presence in the valley for 10 years if this agreement is reached, while the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to a stay period of 5 years.
Because supplementary pest control tests are monitored and their effects evaluated, the shooters participating in this test were subjected to strict supervision by rangers.
Due to a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers are being recruited for the hunting program of the Sports Shooting Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Park Preservation and Heritage Agency (NPWS), the four marksmen selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martell swore an oath in a new ad hoc election management committee (CEP) composed of nine members.
For Marterley, this is the 5th CEP in 4 years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous European Commission in connection with measures to mobilize the country for the upcoming election.
This was a measure taken by President Martelli in response to the widespread spread of anti-government protests that began in October.
This protest action, which sometimes becomes violent, was triggered by the cancellation of the scheduled election and began in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of a problem involving overheating in malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 overheating incidents it considers "not serious."
The ministry responded by saying, "This is truly regrettable" regarding Apple's report delay.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM Friday GMT).
According to the Emergency Management Office (EMO) of the Northern Mariana Islands, there are no reports of damage nationwide.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, has hijacked a bus and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired a M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, but at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, and Filipino photographers were also freed.
Photographers took the place of an elderly woman who wanted to use the restroom.嫌疑者メンドーサ was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went on to pursue a career in medicine.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at that hospital, Riggins started researching premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that administering hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators retrieved two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was also my first manager. Luna passed away on a night when two moons appeared. It was a pretty unique night, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Lannez commented, "Luna was just as crazy as me... or maybe even crazier... I love her and I'll miss her... If possible, I wish she were in heaven."
A survey of 1,400 people conducted prior to the 2010 federal election found that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Julia Gillard, then-prime minister, argued in the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should transition to a republic if Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
A public opinion poll shows that 34% of people agree with this opinion and wish Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Public opinion polls show a polarized result, with 29% of respondents believing Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believing it should not.
That Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their health is in question due to symptoms they reported.
Because the medication he needed to suppress his pain was banned at the tournament, he couldn't take it.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at Central Missouri State University, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
This discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have carried the organic materials that form proteins and sustain life, and served as a source of water for Earth.
Scientists want to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed since a comet collided with the Earth a long, long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, who assumed the governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, is mentioned.
He called this rumor "political gossip and foolishness."
It is speculated that he/she might run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It adopts satellite-based technology, in contrast to conventional ground-based radar technology, allowing controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no special transportation facilities provided, and trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns over the lack of transportation options have led to the possibility of the team having to play in a closed venue without fans in attendance.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, but this process was thought to take much longer because it was the result of interbreeding between the native Galapagos finch and the introduced cactus finch.
Gold is a metal that can be worked into any shape. It is also possible to roll it into a smaller size.
You can pull it to make it wire-like, and then twist or braid it. If you flatten it or roll it, it can also become sheet-like.
It can be spread very thinly and applied to other metals. It can even be made so thin that it is used for the decoration of hand-drawn illustrations called "colored manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make litmus paper with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice reacts with chemicals and changes color depending on whether it's acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Combine the dry flour into two piles and knead it in a circular motion, then firmly squeeze it with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on the hand reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, sewage systems were developed, and almost all dwellings had flush toilets.
Houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini have yielded remnants of sewage systems.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In the Roman civilization era, they were sometimes provided as part of mixed-gender public bath facilities.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, the call automatically goes through a satellite.
Artificial satellites in space receive calls and reflect them almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is because some of the light and scenery that would otherwise enter human vision through the Earth's atmosphere is distorted.
To launch satellites and telescopes and deploy them in space, a massive rocket of 100 feet or more in height is first required.
This wheel incredibly changed the world. The greatest achievement this wheel brought us was making transportation much more comfortable and faster.
Trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation originated from there.
Below that, there are many medium-sized cat-like predators that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to moschis and deer.
Finally, a large number of small cats (including stray cats) that prey on a wide variety of smaller animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds are found living there.
The secret to that success is the concept of a niche, which means each cat has a special job and doesn't compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social feline animals and live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of 1 to 3 related males, approximately 30 females and their offspring.
Usually, the females are closely related to each other and form large families consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride exhibits behaviors similar to those of wolves and dog packs, with the animals remarkably resembling the actions of a lion (or other large cat) in how they hunt and secure their prey.
With a remarkably well-balanced physique and high physical abilities, tigers can climb, swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human (though not with great skill).
Tigers belong to the same animal family (Felidae) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four large cat species that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't a mighty bellow like a lion's; it's more of a menacing threat of a roar.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the prey that ocelots hunt are creatures much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots find and pursue prey by sniffing the ground for scents left by animals (prey) that have passed through.
With excellent night vision, ocelots have very keen eyesight in the dark and are also adept at moving stealthily. They blend into their surroundings and pounce on prey to hunt.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from its larger population (for example, by migrating across a mountain range or river, or moving to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from what they were previously in.
Because this new environment contains different resources and different competitors, the new group will require different characteristics and adaptations than what it needed before, and has the potential to become a strong competitor.
The original group has not changed at all and still requires adaptation in the same way as before.
As a new group begins to adapt to a new environment, it gradually starts to exhibit characteristics different from other groups.
Eventually, after thousands to millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, but it doesn't simply mean the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants create nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build homes with plants and make clothes from plants. Many of the ingredients we eat daily are plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so there was no creature it feared other than other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is lined with over 70 sharp teeth, and there's another row of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning there's no escape once you're through here.
I can't be certain, but it's possible it had a forked tongue. It may have eaten turtles and large fish, and even practiced cannibalism, meaning it ate other mosasaurs.
Furthermore, it will attack anything that enters the water, and even giant dinosaurs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex would be no match for it.
Most of their food was familiar to us, but the Romans ate game and delicacies such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a mouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women preferred to sit down to eat, wealthy men favored banquets where they reclined and relaxed while dining.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included ingredients that came to Europe from America and Asia in the following centuries.
For example, there were no ancient Romans who savored turkey, because there wasn't even corn, tomatoes, or potatoes, let alone cocoa, there.
The Babylonians built a first temple for each of their gods, and these were considered the houses of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to respond to the gods' wishes through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, beyond which lay a Inner Shrine accessible only to priests.
As part of some temples, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built.
The very top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
For the people living in the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
Hebrew families lived mostly outdoors.
Women were cooking in the garden, and the shops were nothing more than stalls facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive and precious.
Greenland was a sparsely populated region. According to Nordic legend, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while sailing west, discovered Greenland and named it so.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already been living there at the time.
While the core identity of all the countries remains "Scandinavian," there were significant differences in the national character, monarchy, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
People who have seen the movie "National Treasure" might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that wasn't the case. Something was written on the back, but it wasn't a treasure map.
The title on the back of the Declaration of Independence read "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." The title was written upside down at the end of the document.
Although it is unknown who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment (measured 29.75 inches x 24.5 inches) was stored rolled up from its earliest practical use.
Therefore, it tends to be added simply as a label.
Northern France was liberated by the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, but the south was not yet liberated.
The rulers were the Vichy French. They made peace with the German army in 1940 and were French people who cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French armies liberated Southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Civilization is a large group of people who live and work together, sharing a common culture, which is society itself.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin adjective *civilis*, meaning "citizen," and is related to the Latin noun *civis*, meaning "citizen," and *civitas*, meaning "city or city-state," which in turn defines the scale of society in some way.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilization and culture mean the inheritance of knowledge over generations, the continuation of cultural legacies, and their equitable dissemination.
Cultures that deviate from the mainstream often disappear without being recognized as formal civilizations, and in that case, no historical evidence remains.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, and the Continental Congress was its sole component.
The assembly had no power to levy taxes, and because there were no national executive or judicial bodies, the assembly relied on state authorities for all of its actions, but the state authorities were often uncooperative.
They also lacked the authority to invalidate interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the articles required unanimous consent from all states, but because the states disregarded the central government, representatives often failed to attend.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, tied with the German national team, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern region, and it has produced Italian athletes who compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands, and the largest of these is Honshu Island, which is considered the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is an archipelago, so it is often called the "Japanese archipelago" geographically.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors called this island "Ilha Formosa" (Beautiful Island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the indigenous people's grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Dynasty.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana (solar clock), the Temple of the Sun (Great Temple), and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to help tourists better understand the traditional appearance.
Machu Picchu had been restored to 30% by 1976, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most popular film format for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the mainstream film size around the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more important than that is the fact that its aspect ratio inherits the format of digital camera image sensors.
I apologize for any confusion, but 35mm film is actually sized at 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this aspect ratio (obtained by dividing by 12 to find the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common record formats (such as those used in APS systems) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
"The rule of thirds" may be overlooked by some, but it's a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining the order of an image.
The most effective place to position the main subject is considered to be the area surrounded by the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
In European history, the Catholic Church, which had become economically prosperous and powerful, was facing a more critical eye during this period.
Christianity has connected European countries with different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
That universal power influenced everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds exist for that specific purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and funds has led many to question whether its doctrines are truly fulfilled.
Soon after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy was effective in cutting off the supply of important military and civilian supplies, but this blockade violated international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries and generally recognized.
The UK laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to their unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant ideologies among citizens and the state were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of the war during World War I, various countries hoped to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States to get a job at Edison's company in New York.
He immigrated to the United States with almost no money, carrying a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique methods for indicating chronological differences, and each stage in Chinese history became characterized by a dynasty ruled by a powerful clan.
Furthermore, between each dynasty, there were unstable periods of fragmented regions. The most well-known of these eras is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In times like these, many nobles were engaged in fierce battles over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people perished in the struggles for power within the grand palaces of Chang'an.
There were many socio-political impacts, including the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, patriotism, and the belief that the nation is not a sovereign power but belongs to the people.
After the revolution, positions became open to public application, and all men were eligible to apply, with the most motivated and capable individual securing the job.
The same can be said of the military. This is because the ranking system has shifted from one based on military rank to one based on ability.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries, and revolutions began in various nations.
Muhammad had a deep interest in issues beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave called "Heela" located on Mount Nour (Light) for meditation.
The cave, which has endured through the ages, vividly reflects the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the mountain peak north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
Actually, even if you know a cave exists, it's not easy to find. Once you enter a cave, it's a completely isolated space.
Looking up, all I see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains surrounding me. From inside the cave, there's hardly a view of the outside world, and no outside sounds can be heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century BC by the Egyptians, is one of the many pyramid structures erected to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau (the Giza necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Kings is home to numerous pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid of Giza), many smaller tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was a massive tomb built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples surrounding it were built to honor Khufu's wife and family.
The upward arrow mark looks like a V, and the downward arrow mark looks like a pushpin's pin or a quadrilateral with a missing base.
Upward movement starts by drawing the bow from the tip, while downward movement starts by drawing the bow from where you hold it with your hand (the frog).
A drawn bow typically produces a softer sound, while a lowered bow creates a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can freely write notes with a pencil, but remember that there are musical reasons for the printed bracket shapes. Generally, you should follow those symbols.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, terrified, along with his Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forcibly driven from the Palace of Versailles to Paris by a mob of women who had turned into rioters.
Riding in a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob who shouted threats at them and showered them with abusive language, facing the king and queen.
The mob, transformed into a riotous crowd, forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows.
One day, before the queen, trembling with fear, a member of the mob displayed the severed head of a royal guard from the Palace of Versailles, waving it about.
The Filipino people bore the cost of the conquest of the Philippines in the war waged by American imperialism.
They were compelled to pay the interest on bonds, sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks, to cover most of their expenditures, as well as to forgo taxes to the American colonial government.
Of course, the excess profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would have formed the foundation of U.S. imperialist surplus.
To understand the Knights Templar, you need to understand the context in which the order arose.
The period in which this incident occurred is called the High Middle Ages, and is generally equivalent to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) in European history.
The Late Middle Ages are conventionally considered the period between the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages as a historical period, and it is generally thought that the Late Middle Ages ended by 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the strict meaning that human destiny is driven by underlying logic related to the manifestation of scientific laws in technology and technological advancement, to more practical perspectives originating from technological promotion and technological norms.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general premises: the first is that the development of technology itself is following a path that transcends cultural and political influences to a significant degree; the second is that technology is not socially conditioned, but rather "influences" the society it is embedded in.
For example, one might say that the development of automobiles inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, because the profit margin on a nationwide road network isn't realized with just a small number of cars, new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The increase in car ownership leads to an increase in road accident rates, which in turn results in the development of new technologies for treating injured bodies in the medical field.
Romanticism had a major element called cultural determinism, formed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and customs and cultures associated with that geography arose over time, harmonizing with the social sphere and proving superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the center of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople flourished as the center of fashion in Europe during the feudal era.
The fame as a center for luxurious clothing began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Their status declined in the 12th century primarily because Crusaders returned with valuable gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than those found in Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of the center of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic period flourished in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The original attire was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europe began to develop its own distinct style. One of the most significant advancements of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the start of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is a form of agriculture where farmers and their families produce only the food necessary for their own consumption.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that aims to maximize yield by combining preserved seeds native to the local ecosystem with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques; it is often organic farming.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this trend is still seen in many developing countries today.
Subculture is a culture where like-minded people who feel marginalized from societal norms gather to nurture their individuality.
A characteristic of subculture is that it can be determined by the age, ethnicity, class, location, gender, and other attributes of its members.
The characteristics that determine subculture may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through symbolic, unique styles that include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to cite the few unfortunate cases of children whose adaptation to society was hindered by adults during their developmental years due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Children like this are called "feral children" or "wild children." Feral children may also be confined by people (usually their parents), and such neglect can occur when parents refuse to raise children with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Orphan children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Furthermore, there are those who are said to have been raised by animals, and those who are said to have lived independently in the wild.
Wild children raised by animals other than humans exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are largely the same as those animals, such as fearing humans or being indifferent to them.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool to support people who are using new computer programs, starting new projects, or having new learning experiences.
Scaffolding comes in both virtual and real forms. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as is the clip art in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is built into this software to enable students to ask questions, receive instructions, and get explanations about procedures that they might find difficult to do on their own.
The reasons why children are placed in foster care range from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
Every child should grow up in an environment with proper care, nurturing, and education, but feral children are growing up in environments lacking those things.
We recognize the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving childcare, solid education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system is designed to provide all necessary necessities that were lacking in the child's home before they were taken in.
The internet is an environment that combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
A prominent feature of the internet is that it leads to further dimensions from the perspectives of usability and user satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" were identified by Eighmey & McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they investigated viewer responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions – subtle facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
They claim that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, you can discern whether someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper "The President's Speech" that even people with brain damage who cannot understand speech can correctly judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior may be common to animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two gene pools regarding genetic mutations: one that is hidden and one that is expressed.
A new genetic mutation is added by a sudden mutation, and it is removed from the pool of variants that have been expressed through natural selection.
Habitat differentiation and recombination shuffle mutations back and forth between the two pools across generations.
For primates with digestive systems like humans, obtaining essential amino acids from plant resources available in savanna environments is difficult.
Furthermore, neglecting that can lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth and malnutrition, and ultimately result in death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins found in leaves and beans, but these are nutrients that are difficult to digest for primates like us unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are a good source of protein that is easy to digest and contains all essential amino acids.
If you consider all aspects, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" just as today's chimpanzees inhabit the savanna.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and then taking a nap (10-60 minutes) before falling back asleep.
This can be easily done by gently bringing consciousness back without fully waking up, using a relatively quiet alarm clock.
When I realized I was unconsciously stopping the alarm, I put the clock on the opposite side of the room to prevent myself from getting out of bed to turn it off.
Another method based on biorhythms is to increase fluid intake (especially water and diuretic teas) before bed to necessitate waking up to urinate.
The degree to which a person's heart finds peace is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the level of tension, the more positive life force is born. Everyone possesses the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is one's own anxieties and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a faith based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the incorporation of many techniques from Mahayana Buddhism's compassion and Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is composed of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness for all.
Kundalini Yoga is a practice that combines yoga postures, breathing techniques, mantras, and mudras to aim for the awakening of Kundalini (the dormant energy or soul).
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment arises.
During World War II, Germany served as a common enemy, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, after the war, the two countries became estranged due to clashes in systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the end of World War II, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War soon began.
Subsequently, this continued for 40 years, and genuine battles were waged on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere by proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
However, these plans were essentially obsolete overnight. After the Soviet Red Army, with over 800,000 soldiers, invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties (bilateral and multilateral), thus forming the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, these plans became irrelevant.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
Traditionally, the Navy's role has been to maintain the capability to transport its own citizens and supplies, while also reliably obstructing the transport of enemy citizens and supplies.
One of the most notable recent examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was primarily using U-boats to try to stop this convoy.
If the Allied forces had lost, Germany would very likely have conquered Britain, just as it had conquered other European countries.
The domestication of goats is believed to have begun approximately 10,000 years ago, with the Zagros Mountains in western Iran as its center.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate goats, which were easily accessible for milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Generally, domestic goats were allowed to roam free in hilly areas and other pastures, and the goat herders who cared for the herds were usually boys. This custom continues to this day.
In England, roadways for wheeled vehicles were already being laid down in the 16th century.
The freight road was simply a track laid with planks side by side, but by horses pulling it, it could transport heavier loads at high speed than the somewhat rough roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early on to secure the rails in their designated positions. It soon became apparent that adding steel caps to the top would improve efficiency.
Although this has become common, iron became a cause of increased wear on the wooden wheels of horse-drawn carriages.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, all-iron rails were first introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and human bipedalism began with the appearance of Homo erectus ("upright man") 2 million years ago.
Australopithecus, our direct ancestors, did not have the habit of continuing to walk upright for a certain amount of time or longer.
Sahalanthropus may have walked upright as early as 7 million years ago, but the characteristics of bipedalism are confirmed in fossils of Australopithecus dating from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago.
You could start living a more environmentally friendly life, participate in environmental activism, or even become an activist to somewhat mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, we need to not only seek temporary solutions but also identify the root cause of the problem and deactivate it.
It is a self-evident fact that the world has changed dramatically due to the advancement of science and technology, and problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap's in a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were reproduced in a single night, and they are now called "Danraku Broadside."
The first public reading of this document was held on July 8th in the garden of the Independence Hall by John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read aloud to the troops in New York on July 9th. The other arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 extant Danrappu broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of these documents. No handwritten originals are currently known to exist.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
However, even now, birds resemble dinosaurs in many ways.
It has feet with scales and claws, is egg-laying, and walks on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Essentially, all computers used today operate based on manipulation of information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers are represented by either of two values (0 or 1), and these numbers are called bits or binary numbers in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Vomiting is a common symptom, so a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Please check the label of the poison for first aid instructions specific to that poison.
Entomologists are using the term "insect" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This name originates from the fact that bedbugs have been prevalent in bedding since ancient times as pests that possess a high adaptability to infest humans.
Both the bed bug and the oriental cockroach are sedentary insects adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States, the number of known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) is estimated to be around 400,000, and it is known as a representative neurological disorder of young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
Some couples may decide that raising children is not beneficial for either parent.
Such couples can use the adoption system for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents lose custody, and another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to elucidate the mechanisms of the world through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
However, that's not all. Experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations also serve as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
What was accepted was Aristotle's view on all matters pertaining to science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Western countries realized they were disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often fundamentally dependent on mechanisms governed by the existence of endogenous cycles and the body clock.
Cyclical rhythms are not simply responses to periodic signals from the outside world, but have been recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The body's internal clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that freely circulates for a certain period, even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most compelling experiments suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Harsey and Chase used phage (viruses) to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one involved labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other involved labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
突然変異は、変異の種類、影響を受けた遺伝物質の欠片の意義、影響を受けた細胞が生殖細胞であるかどうかによって、さまざまな異なる影響を生む可能性があります。 Mutation can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells are passed on to offspring, while mutations that occur in other cells may cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism that emphasizes interaction with nature captivates people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and researching information about ecosystems.
As an example, visiting orangutans in Borneo to take pictures and learn about them is mentioned.
Every morning, people leaving a small rural town and heading to work pass by those who have workplaces near their starting point.
In this dynamic two-way transportation system, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles in some way.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere away from one of the stable states that has supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Anyone who lives a social life uses public transportation. The vast majority of them are dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why do public transportation systems generate such complaints and frequently break down? Is it simply due to incompetent technicians? Or are there more fundamental issues at play?
Traffic flow research is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict a driver's actions with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act rationally and consistently within a reasonable range, and therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain degree of rational consistency, which can be roughly represented mathematically.
To more accurately represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships will be helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. The ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and efficiently find food and companions.
Most insects are designed to fold their wings along their bodies.
This expands the range of narrow spaces available for hiding from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people acknowledged his theory as correct, but many believed the opposite, that the Sun (and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
It doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, so this seems logical, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. Its water volume exceeds eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, with some places having a width of 6 miles.
20% of the water flowing from rivers on Earth into the sea comes from the Amazon River.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. This river collects water flow from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids of Giza stood out from the rest due to their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed by the predecessor monuments built over a thousand years prior.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the world's smallest independent state and also the country with the fewest people.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in laws and official communications.
The most common language used daily by people working in Vatican City is Italian, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
It is known that basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been highly valued by people since ancient times, and all of them can be found in their natural forms in the natural world and relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is close to the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but his theory also proposed that they could transform into new substances to form what we see in this world.
An alloy is, in principle, a mixture of two or more metals. Remember all the many elements listed on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, those that contain nonmetallic elements such as carbon in very small amounts are also classified as alloys.
Everything that exists in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so minuscule that it's possible trillions of them could fit inside the final period of this sentence.
Thus, the pencils that emerged at that time were good friends to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing styles, the status and uses of pencils declined.
Now that more people are entering messages on computer screens, pencil sharpeners are no longer necessary.
I can't help but wonder what will happen to keyboards when something new appears.
Nuclear bombs work on the principle of requiring energy to gather many protons and neutrons into a single nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. When an atomic nucleus is split again, some of its energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei that tend to split spontaneously.
The Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the Earth's crust is approximately 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Beneath the sea, it is thin, and beneath the highlands, it is thick.
Because the crust is thin, there may be more ocean closer to it. Lava was easily rising to the surface.
Content theory centers on finding things that appeal to and fascinate people.
These theories suggest that people harbor certain internalized needs and desires as they transition into adulthood and mature.
These theories examine the motivations of certain groups of people to habitually engage in specific behaviors, as well as environmental factors that either enable or inhibit them from doing so.
The two commonly accepted content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager is in a position to lead former colleagues, two kinds of actions may emerge. One is the behavior of trying to remain "one of the group."
Administrators of this type are often uncomfortable making decisions that draw criticism, handling disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and confirming accountability.
That is the change of individuals who cannot recognize the need to change everything the team has built with their own hands.
Ultimately, the leader will be held ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This action often causes a rift between the leader and the remaining members.
Virtual teams are expected to achieve the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their direct physical groups.
Virtual teams may hold meetings according to time zones, but this is often not understood by local management, so members tend to have a higher degree of autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique characteristic of virtual teams.
"The invisible team" refers to the management team that each member's superior reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why do organizations tend to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of conceptualizing and practicing organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and innovation may arise if all available resources are effectively utilized across organizational functional departments.
As a result, the process of the organization cooperating to overcome obstacles may lead to a new and innovative process for meeting customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must foster not only the sharing of knowledge and organizational learning, but also create an innovation culture.
Angel explained the continuum approach as a method to help organizations reach higher levels of performance in 2006.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research. This allows research areas to be narrowed, enabling more precise studies.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers' studies.
It has long been understood that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies has made it possible to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unclear.
This allows us to obtain a wealth of information and materials that are helpful in constructing simulation models for understanding human mental processes.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation, but it forms a very important field within computer science, processing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation with machines.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
To give an example, it includes features such as control, planning, schedule management, answering customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Those kinds of things have become a separate field focused on solving real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are being integrated into home computers and video game software, while also being used frequently in fields such as economics, healthcare, engineering, and military applications.
Most of the classes are field trips. Teachers frequently take students to places they wouldn't be able to visit by bus.
Technology offers a learning method through virtual field trips. Students can see museum crafts, visit aquariums, and appreciate beautiful art from the comfort of their classroom.
Also, virtually sharing field trips is a wonderful way to reflect on the trip and share the experience in future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about a trip to the state capital every year, and while the website is revised annually, the old sites are archived online for browsing as scrapbooks.
Blogs also help improve students' writing skills. Students who have just started writing blogs tend to be careless with grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers brings about change.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers make an effort to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing a blog enables students to become more familiar with the world surrounding them. This process fosters students' growth into more knowledgeable and interesting individuals, a necessity for capturing the audience's interest (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that encourage students to broaden their learning horizons beyond the scope of traditional classroom instruction, and promote collaborative work.
By appropriately using blogs, students' analytical and critical thinking skills improve. By actively engaging with online materials, students can define their own positions within the contexts written by others and express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming capital city in Canada where two languages are spoken, and there are many museums and galleries that introduce the history and present of Canada.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north stretches untouched natural beauty, including Muskoka.
Thanks to all of these things, Ontario stands out and is widely considered a truly Canadian province by outsiders.
Furthermore, the vast areas to the north have a low population, and there are also pristine regions with hardly anyone living there.
A surprising population comparison: The number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds that of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of the African continent.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and, as a habitat for wildlife, is a unique continent.
The majority of the small islands are either independent nations or countries related to France, and there are also famous luxury beach resorts.
Furthermore, Arabs brought Islam to this land, and it was widely accepted in Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India, passing via the Cape of Good Hope, and this marked the beginning of European influence and colonialism there.
It is a region bordering the Sahel to the north and surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Woman: I recommend that female tourists state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's effective to wear a ring (not too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can sometimes lead to behaviors that are considered harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed or have someone grab your arm.
When declining a man's advances, firmly assert your position with a resolute attitude, without being timid (regardless of cultural differences, you don't need to be swayed by forceful advances!).
The foundation of modern Casablanca dates back to the 10th century BC, when it was built by Berber fishermen and called Anfa. Subsequently, the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenid dynasty utilized this land as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but ultimately abandoned the town after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Dar al-Badia by the Sultan of Morocco and named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post.
Casablanca is one of the least enjoyable places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs, but they are all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, and most of the streets, especially in the town center, were buried.
Sesame is quite safe, but if you visit areas other than where sesame is grown, you need to investigate and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu Province.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nirangongo and is also one of the best places in Africa to track mountain gorillas affordably.
For travel by goma (motorcycle taxi), you can use boda-boda. The usual (local) fare is around 500 Congo Francs for short distances.
The place name "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land, especially because it is not easily accessible.
Timbuktu today is a poor town that has become a tourist destination due to its reputation, and it also has an airport.
To protect it from the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the main destinations featured on the PBS special "Wonders of the African World," produced by Henry Louis Gates.
This city has a strong Arabian influence, more so than an African city, and has an atmosphere that contrasts with other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, running along the borders with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecosystems, each of which is home to different wildlife.
This is one of the main tourist destinations in South Africa and is considered a highlight of South African National Parks (SAN Parks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park charges a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
Purchasing a Wild Card can be a good deal. It allows you entry to major parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is, as its name suggests, a territory of Hong Kong and a popular destination for tourists, serving as a major attraction.
The skyscrapers lining the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a glittering bar graph by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, head out to the island and make your way towards Kowloon's waterfront.
Urban development in Hong Kong Island is concentrated mainly on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
Since this is a place that British colonizers claimed as their territory, those who wish to search for evidence of the colonial era should start here.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) along the coast from Bangladesh to the inland regions of India.
The Sundarbans are registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp where only mangroves grow. It also includes the last remaining place where the vast jungle that once covered the Hindustani Plain still exists.
The area of Sundarbans is 3,850 km², and about one-third of it is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and currently, it is estimated to be home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since the limited express bus is often crowded, it is recommended to purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have Japanese-made coaster buses operating, all of which are comfortable and sturdy small buses.
Taking a taxi is convenient for traveling to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 nyultam) and Punakha (200 nyultam).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge, spanning the Oyapock River, connects the Brazilian city of Oyapock and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 m high and 378 m long, and the bridge has two lanes with a width of 3.50 m.
The overhead space of the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011, but not opened to the public until March 2017.
The full opening of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, and is expected to occur around the time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are completed.
The Guarani people are the most significant indigenous people inhabiting eastern Paraguay today, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practicing self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by groups such as the Guayquil and Payaguá people, indigenous groups that survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay was born in the 16th century through the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous people (formerly known as the "Giant Province of the West Indies").
The Spanish colonial era began, and it lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained many of its indigenous characteristics and uniqueness.
Argentina is famous for having the world's best polo teams and polo players.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Club.
Small-scale tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times.
Please check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo for the schedule and ticket purchase locations for the polo tournament.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British Pound (GBP) at a rate of 1 pound to 1 pound.
Currency exchange can be done at the only bank on Stanley Island (across from FIC West).
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the island, and Stanley travel cards and US dollars are also widely used.
On remote islands, you can use British and US currency, but credit cards likely won't be accepted. It's a good idea to confirm accepted payment methods with the owner beforehand.
Since it's first impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency after leaving the island, let's exchange it before leaving.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when the Northern Hemisphere is winter, it is summer, and when the Northern Hemisphere is summer, it is winter.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures often exceed 30°C (86°F) in the summer.
Although the temperature rarely drops below freezing, it can sometimes feel colder than the thermometer indicates due to the combined effects of wind and humidity.
There isn't a distinct rainy season or dry season; rainfall is relatively consistent throughout the year.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but even so, wild animals are still wild, so you should not feed them or startle them.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards (100 meters) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (25 meters) from all other wildlife!
Even if they seem docile, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured due to not maintaining a safe distance. These wild animals are large and potentially dangerous, so let's avoid entering their territory.
Also, to avoid attracting wild animals such as bears, avoid carrying or cooking food that smells, and strive to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia is a city founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is a famous location where navy ships once faced off after seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to set sail in 1889.
All ships were sunk except for one British battleship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost in this battle.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, the highest leader Tupua Tamasese Rereofi III was killed at a peaceful assembly held in the town.
Oakland is blessed with two harbors and many beaches. Popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Harbor District) faces the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of it is a sandy beach where you can swim safely, and the shade of the Pohutukawa trees provides sun protection.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Mission Bay and Waiheke Harbour in the suburbs of central Auckland, an upscale residential area.
These are family-friendly beaches that sometimes get crowded, and various shops line the coast. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is called "Number One," and although it's not an elaborate beer, it's refreshing and has a clean, crisp taste. The other local beer is called "Manta."
French wine is readily available, but since we're on a trip, let's try some wines from New Zealand or Australia.
The tap water in the area is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is readily available.
The concept of a "flat white" (with milk) coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is simply "espresso," cappuccino is served with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Warm chocolate is a beverage that meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice drinks are expensive but very delicious.
Travel to coral reefs is possible year-round, and injuries due to the above-mentioned reasons on coral reefs are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish inhabit the coastal areas and near river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not make the sea their primary habitat; their main habitat is the river estuary north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance provides travelers with peace of mind, knowing they'll have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Many travel agencies have contracts with specific hotels, but you may also be able to book other accommodations like campgrounds through them.
Typically, travel agencies offer arrangements for breakfast, transportation between the airport and hotel, or packages combining flights and hotels.
Also, you can put your reservation on hold if you need time to consider an offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to take with you on your trip.
However, please do not contact the hotel directly with change requests or requests; first, contact the travel agency.
Depending on the festival, it is customary for the majority of music festival attendees to camp within the venue, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to experience it firsthand, you need to arrive early and secure a campsite where you can easily hear the music.
Please remember that there might be a section at the festival that continues playing music late into the night, even after the main stage performances end.
Depending on the festival, some may have special campsites set up for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, please check the location of your cabin. The cabin most affected by cutting through the ice will be subject to terrifyingly loud noises.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are visa-exempt (please check the conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize guests' time and money spent there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
Casinos typically offer special dining and entertainment options to ensure guests have a pleasant stay within the facility.
Depending on the venue, alcoholic beverages are served. However, skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober because alcohol impairs judgment.
People who drive in high latitudes or mountain passes need to consider the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-freezing temperatures.
Snowy and icy roads have low friction, so you can't drive as you would on an asphalt road.
When a blizzard hits, enough snow falls in a very short time to cause significant delays.
Also, sometimes it snows and the wind blows, and the windows get covered in condensation or ice, limiting visibility.
On the other hand, while many countries experience frequent snow and ice, transportation continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the best tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many tourists.
Safari refers to a land-based journey undertaken for the purpose of observing wildlife, particularly animals found in the savanna of Africa.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach vehicles, so you can observe them clearly by using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are surprisingly timid, so you'll often need to use binoculars to get a good look.
Walking safari (also known as "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking tour") is a program that involves walking through a safari zone for several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Competitions will also be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice since the 1964 Games.
Those who booked 2020 airline tickets and accommodations before the postponement announcement may find themselves in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most COVID-19 related cancellation policies will not be extended until the Olympic Games, which were scheduled for July 2020.
Event tickets are priced between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets expected to cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board if you ask, even if they aren't in the room.
If you don't have an iron or want to dry socks or other items without ironing, you might want to try using a hairdryer.
Please be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, lead to burning).
There are various methods for water purification, and there are also advanced treatment methods effective against specific risks that pose a threat to the quality of drinking water.
Some areas boil in one minute, while others take many minutes to boil.
There's a difference in the effectiveness of filters, so if you're concerned, consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter plant or animal pests unfamiliar to their own region.
Pests can spoil food, bite skin, cause allergic reactions in the worst cases, spread toxins, and transmit infectious diseases.
Infections themselves and dangerous animals that kill or injure people by force are usually not considered harmful organisms.
Tax-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from consumption tax and sales tax at specific locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes may be able to save a significant amount of money, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the least-traveled segment of the major highway connecting Buffalo and Pittsburgh, frequently passing through isolated, undeveloped forests.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, please be careful of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves, and do not let your guard down.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections, generally being 35-40 mph (56-64 km), and strict adherence to this speed limit is considered more important than in other sections.
However, strangely enough, mobile phone service is well-developed here compared to many other areas (such as Pennsylvania Wilds).
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they are similar to the pastries of neighboring Austria to the south, with a wide variety of types.
Fruit-filled sweet bread is common, and apples are cooked as a topping year-round, with cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods use nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. Popular cakes go particularly well with strong coffee.
If you want to try a small but rich pastry, please try Berliner, Pfuffkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made by simmering meat and vegetables in a sauce based on herbs and spices.
Curry is classified as either "dry" or "wet" depending on its water content.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is frequently used in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in curries in southern India and the coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine, which can be chosen from among 17,000 islands, is a general term for the truly diverse regional cuisines found throughout this country.
However, if used without adding any further modifiers, it refers to cuisine from central and eastern Java.
Currently widely popular throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by its simple seasoning, with main seasonings including peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
A "abumi" is the part of a saddle that hangs on both sides and supports the rider's feet.
This will make the ride quite stable, but because the rider's feet can get caught, safety concerns may arise.
There is a risk of being dragged along by the horse when it tries to run, if your foot gets caught in the stirrup at the moment you are thrown from the horse. Several safety measures can be taken to minimize this danger.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth heel and a relatively narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly those made in Britain, have safety bars that are designed to release the girth straps if the rider is about to fall off and is pulled backward.
Cochamo Valley is a mountaineering area in Chile, known as the "Yosemite of South America," featuring massive granite walls and numerous rock formations.
From the summit, a breathtaking view unfolds. Climbers from around the world continue to establish new routes, surrounded by walls brimming with infinite possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve wearing skis or a snowboard on your feet and gliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip, and many enthusiasts called "ski maniacs" are planning vacations centered around skiing at specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very old, with depictions of skiers found in cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC.
The history of ski mountaineering as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
These are related to alpine-style cross-country skiing and mountaineering, but are usually not included, and the latter requires sturdier skis and boots for climbing up and down steep terrain.
Think of the ski route as being similar to a hiking route.
If the conditions are good, I can cover a slightly longer distance than walking, but it's very rare to be able to travel at the speed of cross-country skiing – a speed where I can move with a heavy backpack on a groomed course.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a large number of independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries will require you to apply for visas and undergo immigration checks repeatedly.
However, the Schengen Area functions like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay within this area, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo immigration checks multiple times.
Similarly, once you obtain a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which significantly saves time, costs, and administrative hassle.
There is no universally accepted definition of antiques. Depending on the tax office, items over 100 years old may be defined as antiques.
This definition may have geographical variations, and in North America, for example, the range of age restrictions may be narrower than in Europe.
Handicrafts have a shorter history than mass-produced imitations, but they can sometimes be defined as antiques.
Reindeer herding is a vital means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for many people who earn a living through other occupations.
However, the Sami people have not traditionally been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they have made a living through fishing and hunting, so reindeer were mostly kept as working animals.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern trade. Tourism is a significant source of income for the Sámi region.
The term "Gypsy" is widely used among people other than Romani people, but it is often considered an offensive term because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If a country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance and travel cancellation insurance.
While it might be of little use to refer to advice from governments other than our own, such advice is intended for that country's citizens.
For example, Americans living in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendation is merely a summary of the security situation in a certain country.
The presented viewpoints are often superficial, oversimplified, and lack depth compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather refers to a general term for hazardous meteorological phenomena that can lead to physical damage, serious social disruption, and loss of life.
Severe weather can be seen anywhere in the world, and its types vary depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are caused by severe weather phenomena and their effects, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Severe weather phenomena with a regional or seasonal impact include blizzards, whiteouts, freezing rain, and sandstorms.
We strongly recommend that travelers be aware of the risk of adverse weather conditions that could impact the destination region, as this may affect travel plans.
All people planning to travel to countries that could be considered conflict zones must undergo specialized training.
Searching for "Adversarial Environment Course" on the internet will likely yield the addresses of local companies.
Courses generally cover every issue discussed here in considerable detail and usually include practical exercises.
Courses typically last 2 to 5 days and may include training in role-playing, first aid, and sometimes weapon handling.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are not uncommon, but publications about conflict zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery overseas must ensure they carry valid identification documents that can prove their identity upon their return to their home country.
The government's stance on issuing passports without a gender designation (with "X" in the gender field) or renewing documents with names or genders according to the individual's wishes varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to recognize these documents is also very diverse.
Since the period after September 11, 2001, inspections at security checkpoints have become even more intrusive.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not assume they can pass through scanners while maintaining privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are powerful, narrow currents that flow away from the shore, and they often occur around reefs or similar submerged structures.
Due to the underwater topography, return currents are concentrated in a few deep areas, and fast currents heading towards the deep sea can form there.
Most causes of death are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, but swimming against the current is likely impossible.
If you break away from the current, it's not that difficult to swim back.
Should we aim for a place where we won't get caught by the waves again, or if you're aware that you don't have confidence in your swimming ability, it might be better to wait for rescue?
Return culture shock can happen sooner, last longer, and worsen more severely than the shock of entering the country again (especially when there isn't much time for a honeymoon).
Even travelers who easily adapted to a new culture may struggle to adjust to the local culture.
After living abroad and returning home, you tend to lose some of your native culture's habits because you've adapted to a new culture.
For a first overseas trip, people around you will likely be patient and try to understand, because they know it takes getting used to traveling.
People may not expect that returning home will also require patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the attractions that children especially enjoy at this tourist spot.
In the darkness, you can see the pyramid, and before the performance, you can view the pyramid in silence.
Normally, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and business people here. The story woven from sound and light is like a picture book.
The Sphinx serves as both the backdrop for a long tale and as a narrator.
Under the night sky, images appear on the pyramids, and the pyramids are illuminated one after another.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and currently have 16 active bases in 2020, making them the most heavily utilized.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Besides Livingston Island and Deception Island, a magnificent natural harbor stretches out, formed by the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern region of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula merge to form a plateau, and then merge again to form the 360 km-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minotoba Glacier.
In the northern Sentinel Range lies the Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, with Vinson Massif itself towering at an elevation of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phone signals don't reach, satellite phones may be the only option.
Satellite phones are, fundamentally, not a replacement for cell phones. This is because you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used by vessels such as pleasure crafts, as well as exploration teams requiring data and audio in remote locations.
Regarding how to connect to this service, your local phone company should be able to provide you with detailed information.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option among students planning a gap year.
It's particularly popular among graduates who are unsure about their future career path, and utilizing this allows you to take a gap year without affecting your academic record before entering university.
In many cases, enrolling in an overseas gap year program makes it easier to actually proceed to university after returning home.
Normally, there is a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a perfect country for boating. As the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland boasts thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
Yachts are not always necessary in the islands or lakes.
The coastal islands and the largest lake are certainly big enough to enjoy sailing yachts, but you can also have a different experience with small boats or kayaks.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with approximately one in seven to eight people owning a boat.
It's roughly comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's very rare in other countries (e.g., 1-40 people in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia).
In other words, you can spend 2-3 days sightseeing in the historical town while sleeping on the boat at night.
If you are landing only by using a sightseeing boat, you do not need to obtain a separate visa (as of 2009).
Depending on the cruise, the information booklet includes Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is located inland, and sightseeing in the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly for those who have never flown or have experienced traumatic events.
That is not something to be ashamed of; it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have.
Understanding the mechanisms of airplanes and how they behave in flight can sometimes help overcome fear of the unknown or things you cannot control.
Delivery drivers earn high pay for urgent deliveries. Often, it's crucial that documents, goods, or replacement parts needed for urgent repairs arrive quickly.
In some lines, large corporations possess their own aircraft, but problems existed in other lines and for small businesses.
When shipping luggage via air cargo, it could sometimes take several days for the cargo to be unloaded and clear customs depending on the flight route.
To get it through quickly, we had no choice but to send it as checked baggage. According to the airline's rules, luggage cannot be sent if there are no passengers, so what happens after that is crucial.
To fly first class or business class, you naturally have to pay a higher price commensurate with the level of service (if it's a business trip, try negotiating with your employer).
However, it is by no means cheap. As a rough guide, business class costs about four times and first class costs about eleven times what you would pay for regular economy class.
Generally speaking, it's pointless to search for discounted business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there exists a core group of passengers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably to their destination, which is why they charge such fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic state and has been plagued by ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the birth of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994. The republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between these two regions of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, facing the Aegean Sea, is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a major transportation hub.
Formerly an ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling commercial center, modernly developed and surrounded by mountains around a large bay.
Wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, old mosques and churches, synagogues, and more, giving the area a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than a distinctly Turkish one.
From the village of Harudalsik, you can see the nearby Estroy Island, and the village has a rare octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some graves are adorned with interesting marble dove sculptures.
It's worth taking about 30 minutes to stroll through a village that piques your interest.
In the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron passionately spoke of its wonders.
The Scuttarbus 403 to Sintra runs regularly and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, if you're going north, let's visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous Marian shrine.
Please do not forget that what you have visited is essentially a massive cemetery, and a graveyard of immeasurable significance to the vast majority of the world's population.
Here, many men and women who survived that time live, and there are also many people, regardless of whether they were Jewish or not, who had loved ones murdered or forced into labor.
Please show respect appropriate to the setting and conduct yourselves with dignity and decorum. Joking about the Holocaust or Nazis is absolutely unacceptable.
Let's refrain from actions that deface landmarks, such as graffiti with paint or knives.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, since Catalan is established as the first official language by law, most signs are displayed in Catalan only.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transportation and other places.
While regular announcements within and on the metro are only in Catalan, in the event of delays due to accidents or other issues, announcements are made in multiple languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese via an automated system.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, arrogant, and rude.
This is just a stereotype, but the best way to succeed in Paris is to act like a "well-bred" person and behave in the best way possible. That way, you'll be able to get by comfortably.
He may seem unapproachable at first, but he'll quickly change once you demonstrate basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site brimming with breathtaking scenery, featuring 16 lakes of various sizes scattered throughout vast forests where Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation coexist (mainly beech, spruce, and fir).
Due to the microclimate and the extremely wide range of soil and altitude, there is a very rich variety of plant communities.
Furthermore, this region is home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
Rare species such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, wildcats, Japanese wildcats, and capercaillie can be seen, and many common species coexist with them.
When visiting a monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but bringing your own, especially something in a particularly bright color, will likely earn you a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can borrow these at the reception desk near the entrance, but considering they aren't washed for each user, some people might be hesitant to wear them. They are a one-size-fits-most for men.
Mallorcan cuisine, like other regions of the Mediterranean, features bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as its main ingredients, and makes frequent use of olive oil.
Especially in the summer, a simple dish called "Panbori," consisting of bread topped with olive oil and seasoned with tomatoes, cheese, tuna, and other condiments, is popular.
All nouns, like "Sie" which refers to "you", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
It can be somewhat complex for writers to determine whether verbs and adjectives are used in a form where they have been personified, but it is certain to be easier for readers.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, and most words are pronounced as they are written.
Pronunciation changes based on the next vowel, so the main characters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g'.
Furthermore, "caro" means "dear," whereas "carro" means "tank," so it's important to pay attention to the distinction between the pronunciation of "r" and "rr."
Persian is relatively easy to learn, and most of it follows standard grammar.
Therefore, reading the introductory section of this grammar book will make it easier for you to learn about Persian grammar and understand expressions.
It goes without saying, but if you know any Romance language, you should find it easy to learn Portuguese.
However, those who know a little Spanish might rush to conclude that Portuguese is not a language worth studying separately because it is so close.
Observatories before the early modern period are now mostly obsolete and closed down, with some remaining as museums or educational facilities.
The pollution at its worst was of a different kind than today's problems, and since it occurred in urban areas and schoolyards, it felt more immediate than modern issues.
Many of the latest research telescopes are installed in remote locations as large facilities so they can be used for observations under good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as *hanami*, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept originated from China, where people have a fondness for plum blossoms.
The first flower viewing party held in Japan was organized by the Emperor himself, exclusively for himself and the nobility residing around the Imperial Court.
Since plants look their best in their natural environment, please resist the temptation to take back just "one" specimen as a sample.
If you visit a meticulously maintained garden and try to collect "specimens," you will be asked to leave without any room for excuse.
Singapore is generally very safe, very easy to get around in, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
However, since it is located in the "high-latitude tropics," a few degrees north of the equator, you need to deal with both constant heat and strong sunshine (though occasionally during clear weather).
Also, there are a few buses heading north towards Hebron, a legendary burial ground where the patriarchs of the Bible—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—and their wives are said to be buried.
Please confirm that the bus you are getting on is not only heading towards the Jewish settlement near Killiyat Al-Aba, but also to Hebron.
A stroll along inland waterways will make for an interesting theme for spending a holiday.
For example, you could visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a Danube River cruise to charming towns, or go boating on the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for popular hiking and cycling courses.
Christmas is the birthday of Jesus and is celebrated as one of the most important holidays in Christianity.
Various traditions related to holidays are accepted not only by Christians living in Christian countries but also by non-Christians around the world.
There is a traditional custom of spending the night in a place with a clear view to watch the sunrise on Easter morning.
Of course, there are theological explanations within Christianity regarding this tradition, but it may be based on spring and fertility rituals observed before the Common Era.
In more traditional churches, a Good Friday vigil is often held on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, and at midnight, it is customary for believers to begin a celebration to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
The animals that first arrived in the Galapagos Islands all came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because they are isolated from the mainland, mammals cannot migrate, and the Galapagos giant tortoise became the primary herbivore of the Galapagos.
Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs have been brought there.
In winter, you can experience "polar night," where the sun doesn't rise above the horizon in places like the Arctic and Antarctic.
This phenomenon causes the sky to be dark for almost 24 hours, making it a good opportunity to see the aurora.
This area has a sparse population and very little light pollution, so you can enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues typically address each other by last name and title.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and to that end, group efforts are emphasized over individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain their superior's approval for anything they do, and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
