Furthermore, the people who were able to [do something] have gained a significant sum of 1000 dollars." **Important Considerations:** * **"ahunda" and "zia"**: These words are context-dependent and could have multiple meanings. I've interpreted them as "discussing" and "able to," respectively. * **"so ti zia na terê ni so ayake gui azo so ngu"**: This is a complex phrase relating to the ancestral blood and its connection to a positive outcome for the villagers. * **"alíngbi ti vo ni"**: "alíngbi" means "because of this" or "therefore." "vo ni" is related to the villagers or people of the village. * **"ape tongana ala vo ni alingbi ala futa nginza dollar 1000"**: This indicates a significant monetary gain. "futa nginza" means a large amount. Because of the richness and nuance of Sango, a perfectly precise translation without further context is challenging. This is the best interpretation based on the provided sentence.
