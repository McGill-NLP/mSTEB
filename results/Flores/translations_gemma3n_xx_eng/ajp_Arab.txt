This isn't just confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but it provides details that fossils generally can't offer, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scholars have said that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top with pale or carotene-colored underside edges.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed blood vessel system; it's called the rachis. But there were other traits of the feathers—the barbs and barbules—and researchers concluded that rachis most likely evolved gradually later on to develop these other traits.
The feather structure suggests they weren't using them for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that despite this tail being from a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of a large animal, not a hatchling's feathers.
The researchers suggested that, even though it's the fault of a little dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers, not chick feathers.

The deceased were Nicolas Aldin, 25, and Zachary Coudippac, 21. Coudippac was the driver.
Edgar Viguela sustained injuries to his hand and jaw, and Christopher Schneider was left behind because he needs reconstructive surgery on his face.
Oka's weapon failed when it was pointing at the head of the fifth man. Schneider suffered from persistent pain and blindness in one eye, and lost a part of his skull, with his sons' faces replaced with titanium.
Shahd Schneider gave a statement via video link from the U.S. Air Force base in his hometown.
After the Wednesday event, Carpanedo competed in two races alone in the championship.
Her first race was a slalom, and she won the "Not Yet Finished" award in the first lap. 36 out of 116 competitors reached the same result in that race.
And in another race, the giant cyclo-cross race, I took tenth place in the women's seated group with an elapsed time of approximately 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Claudia Luchs of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four snowboarders failed to complete the ladies' seated slope, and 45 of the 117 total snowboarders failed the giant slalom race in the rankings.
The police helped me get back my stolen laptop and phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
Let's celebrate the successes in the name of Baba Kangar, Botoha Kangar, Rambro Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
And the police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court and their charge is covered up.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one inside was injured.
With this driver, he sustained serious head injuries.
Close off the road where the accident happened for a short time while emergency services are released the driver from the red Audi T T car.
And they transferred him initially to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
They transferred him after that to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
And from that time on, Adikuya was in the Sheriff's court in Edinburgh, accused of killing her son.
She's detained awaiting charges and trial, but any evidence from a witness could be tainted because her image has spread widely.
It's a common practice in other places in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently and the courts considered that publishing the images could be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes "that one journalist appears to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos and so on of the suspects."
The Royal Court announced, which is responsible for legal proceedings, to the journalists that no new comment will be made at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Middle East War in 1967.
And among the other topics that were covered, according to what was reported, is the future state of the Holy City of Jerusalem for both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the Valley for ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to leave this presence for five years.
The marksmen in the supplementary pest control trial were under close supervision by forest rangers, and the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated there.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Sullivan, Acting Director of Parks and Protected Areas, NPWS, the four marksmen selected for the initial firing exercise received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday in a new, temporary electoral council (CEP) of nine members.
It is his fifth CEP test for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee spoke about Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Violent protests have begun in some instances due to the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in malfunctioning iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 9:19 PM GMT).
The Emergency Management Office in Northern Mariana said there are no reported damages in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications of a tsunami occurring.
A former Filipino police officer in South Lebanon took tourists from Hong Kong hostage and kidnapped their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza from Baroude shot tourists with an M16.
We rescued a good number of hostages, and we're sure at least six are dead for now.
We managed to free six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino photographers.
After that, the photographers took a break in a very nice place because they needed to use the restroom. Then they got Mendoza.
Legons followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Legons started investigating premature births in his spare time.
The result of his research is that if we give him the hormone, it will speed up the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
The wrestlers are Luna's colleagues and praise her a lot.
Tomi Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Truly one of a kind, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was terrifying like me... even more... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, said that she believes Australia needs to become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this opinion, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The last thing you could imagine is that 29 percent of those surveyed say Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
They were supposed to have the swimmer with the Olympic gold medal compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle races, and in three events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has become questionable.
He couldn't get the necessary medication to overcome his pain, so they were prevented from participating in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics researcher and computer science professor at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using various devices and programs by early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, when comets collided with it a long time ago.
Kumo, who is 53 years old, began his tenure as governor earlier this year, and a bill passed last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
They are expecting him to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow pilots to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
They are using a technology that relies on satellites instead of old technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to identify pilots with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no additional transportation options running, and the trains won't stop above ground in Wembley, and parking and drop-off/pick-up facilities are not available on the ground.
People's fear of limited transportation has increased the possibility of forcing the match to be played behind closed doors without the home team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process takes much longer due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch and the Geospiza fencepost finch, Geospiza conirostris.
We can create different shapes with gold, and it can also be rolled into small forms.
It might be pulled onto thin wires, and those wires could be twisted and wrapped. It might also be hammered or wrapped around sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is its name, the pH of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry ingredients together, then squeeze them in a clean, damp ball of hands.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, and this creates a strange feeling and forms a kind of coating.
My city, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, had a well-organized bathroom in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
They discovered remains of sewage networks in houses in the cities of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also bathhouses in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, bathhouses were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call, then reflects it a second time, right away, right away.
They launched the satellite into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
This thing needs a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The Wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel provided is an easier and faster means of transportation.
She got us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
It dwells underneath, consuming medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Lastly, there are many, but small cats (including stray feral cats) that eat the most abundant small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status, which is a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Bridal groups consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and a cub.
Women are usually close to each other because they're a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lions act with a great deal of pride, similar to wolf or dog packs, and the animals remarkably resemble lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, is capable of climbing (though not exceptionally well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same genus (as the tiger) as lions, leopards, and clouded leopards. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't like the roar of a lion at full volume, but it resembles a persistent, glaring phrase.
I love the otter eating small animals. They will hunt monkeys, hyraxes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that otters hunt are much smaller than what they are.
Scientists believe that vultures can track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling and detecting their location on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very stealthily. The owls hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, then pounce on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from their main population (like if they migrate across a mountain range or river, or to a new island and can't easily return), they usually won't find themselves in an environment different from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new residents will need different features or adjustments to be strong competitors than what they needed before.
The native population hasn't changed at all, and they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new residents start adjusting to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the remaining residents.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two societies will be completely different, and we won't be able to call them the same kind of thing.
We call this process diversification, and it's only meant to create new types. Diversification is a result of something unavoidable and a very important part of development.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (meaning, their breath out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. And they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make containers from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its time, so he wasn't afraid of anything, except for other Mosasaurs.
Its long fangs are encrusted with more than 70 teeth, in addition to another set at the top of its jaw, which means there's no escape for anything in its path.
I'm not sure, but maybe it had a branched tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs; maybe it even ate humans.
It also attacked everything that entered the water. Even the giant dinosaur like a T. rex, there wasn't one like it.
By the time most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have unusual or uncommon elements for the holiday, which are wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the zaghba.
The second difference was that when the poor and women would eat their food while sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to have feasts together and would relax on their sides while eating their meals.
It didn't include ancient Roman meals, or foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Meaning, for example, they didn't have a single bit of anything – not tomatoes, not potatoes, not cocoa, and not even one ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered their dwelling place.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and they tried to have the priests fulfill the gods' needs through celebrations and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, they would build special towers shaped like pyramids, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The part at the top of the tower was a special place for the god.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't very important.
Most of the Jewish family's life became outdoors.
The women used to cook in the square; the shops were just open counters facing the street. And they used stone to build the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland settled down a bit. In Scandinavian sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at that time.
Despite all countries being "Scandinavian," there were still many differences between people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the National Treasure movie, you'll remember that the map to the treasure was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence ad.
And with that, this isn't right. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
It was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located under the document, upside down.
And at a time when no one knew exactly who wrote it, it is known that in its early life, the large manuscript document (size 29 inches x 24 inches) was encased for storage.
So, they probably just added the encoding as a simple label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south wasn't liberated yet.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and called the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France and were heading to Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civilized," and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state." This also defines the size of a society in a specific way.
Countries or cities are the ancestors of nations. Cultural civilization is the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Often, minor cultures disappear without leaving historical evidence related to them, and they fail to acknowledge them as suitable civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies formed a weak central government for the first time – and Congress was the sole governing body – according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress failed because it lacked the authority to impose taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce its actions.
And also, there isn't a way to overcome tax and tariff laws between states.
The documents required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the countries took the central government with great disregard, to the point that their representatives are mostly absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, المبارزة (fencing/duel), rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, as Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Due to the archipelago/group of islands that make up Japan, it is often said, from a geographical perspective, that Japan is a "single archipelago."
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "sweet island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to shift indigenous grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after they lost the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Chamber.
They rebuilt most of the buildings on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
When 1976 came, we recovered thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and the restoration process continues to this day.
For example, the common photography format among people for still photos worldwide is 35mm, which is the widespread size of film at the end of the analog film era.
To this day, they're still using it, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the shapes of sensitive digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is really something that confuses people, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
That's why they say the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many known formats (like the APS format group, for example) equal or are very close to the aspect ratio we were talking about.
The rule of thirds they use is often wrong, and what people usually mock about it is the simple guiding principle that creates dynamism and maintains a bit of order in the image.
The rule states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see this example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion linked European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Its comprehensive power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the basic Christian principles is that we must use wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money the Church has is actually for that reason.
The central authority was subordinate to the Church in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this thing is that the authority and the money were with them, which caused many to question whether they truly adhered to this principle.
After a short period from the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven successful, having cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates generally accepted international law and what was codified in numerous international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain has encroached on international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, and this is a danger even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were peacefulness and isolation.
After they saw the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batcheller (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each era of China, or each dynasty in power, was a distinct lineage.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided prefectures. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war erupted between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died while sitting on the highest seat in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, professions were open to all young applicants, and this allowed the most ambitious and successful people to succeed.
This applies to the army as well, because instead of the army's rankings being based on class, they now rely on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their revolutions.
Mohammad was very interested in things that went beyond worldly life. He would go to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate there.
The cave itself, which was able to withstand time until this very moment, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations, peace be upon him.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Seriously, let's talk about it. It's not easy to find, even if someone knows it exists. Because as soon as you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the beautiful clear sky above and a bit of the surrounding mountains. Very little of what you can see from this world is inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "City of the Tombs of Giza," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper قوس" symbol is like the letter V, and the "lower قوس" symbol is like a fundamental element or a square minus its bottom side.
Up means you should start from the end and pull the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (holding your hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
Typically, the upper arch makes a softer sound, while the lower curve is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to sketch your own marks with the pencil, but remember that the printed bending marks are there for musical reasons, so you absolutely have to respect them.
King Louis XVI, the terrified Queen Marie Antoinette, and their young children (Marie Thérèse, who was 11 years old, and Louis Charles, who was four years old), along with the King's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles due to a large group of market women.
In Arabic, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by crowds of people shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of fans forced the King and Queen to fully open their car windows.
Once, a single person from the audience threw something at the head of one of the royal guards who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves bore the expenses of the American imperialist war in the invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system to bear a significant portion of the expenses and benefits on bonds that were floated under the name of the Philippine government through banks in Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits they're making from the long exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute fundamental gains for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one has to understand the context that led to their founding.
The era in which these events happened is called the High Middle Ages; it's a period in European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and after the Late Middle Ages, with a general agreement that they ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from the drive of technology or technological necessity to the strict feeling that the destiny of humankind is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism generally share two ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond the cultural or political influence to a large extent, and that this technology, in turn, has "unique effects" on established societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
I mean, for example, one could say that cars make it necessary to develop roads.
However, the national road network doesn't have economic viability for a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership is increasing the rate of road accidents, which leads to the innovation of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romance had a significant element of cultural determinism, taken from books like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged. These, in harmony with the community's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the way Paris is known for being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It began with its reputation as a center of luxury, around 400 meters, and extended to about 1100 meters.
Her status declined in the 12th century, and this is mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts like silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
And with that, due to the slow communication channels, patterns in the West could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, a result of the Crusades, was the start of people using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farming they do to produce something enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses locally saved original seeds in the environmental area, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers used to work subsistence farming, and it's still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ways of thinking who have felt marginalized by societal norms, and they allow them to develop a sense of identity.
It's possible that subcultures are distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
It's possible that the characteristics that define a distinct subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Generally, "Bino" (likely referring to a specific group or subculture) recruits members through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behaviors, and argumentation.
One of the common ways used to highlight the importance of socialization is to rely on a small number of unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, did not have adults socializing with them during their development.
They call these children "wild" or feral. Some of these children are institutionalized by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's significant intellectual or physical disability.
It's possible that the feral children suffered from child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
They claim that animals raised humans; they say a part of them used to live in the wild on their own.
When a child is raised among non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (within material limits) that closely resemble the behaviors of the animals they were raised with, such as their fear of humans or their indifference towards them.
While it should make learning based on practical projects easier and more engaging, the scaffolding goes further than that.
Scaffolding isn't a way to learn, but it's a support tool that gives assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, like using new computer software or starting a new project.
It's possible that scaffolding is both virtual and real; in other words, the "teacher" is a form of scaffolding, and it's also the small paperclip icon in Microsoft Office.
The program incorporates virtual scaffolds aimed at posing questions and prompting for answers, and explaining procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle independently.
Children are placed in alternative care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
A child won't be raised properly in an environment that doesn't care for or nurture them, or teach them; they just end up this way.
We know that foster care is a safe area for these children.
It should provide an adoption system that offers safe homes, friendly caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
It should be that you provide all the necessities that the homes we took them from previously needed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead us to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and satisfaction.
Like "learning" and "socialization," they suggest them as important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
They also added "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new motivations, according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their study of audience reactions on websites.
Using video recordings allowed us to discover important things in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last only fractions of a second.
Specifically, they say that one can discover if someone is lying by interpreting their microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Letter," clarified how individuals unable to comprehend language due to brain damage can still accurately assess truthfulness with such evaluations.
Even they suggest that abilities like these, which explain human behavior, might be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century clarified that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The boom introduced new genetic diversity, and it removed the specificity from the expressed range of variation.
The process of separation and re-integration involves a back-and-forth exchange of differences between the two groups with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it's difficult for ruminants – animals with a digestive system like humans – to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Also, failure is something with bad consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death in the end.
The most accessible plant resources are proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for humans like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) aren't easy to digest, but they also provide a high quantity of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything we've taken into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "first protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and sleeping again after a short time (10-60 minutes).
We can easily do this using a relatively gentle alarm to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so it forces you to get out of bed to stop it.
The other bio-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more the life force's positivity increases. Every person has the ability to find peace and complete contentment.
It's possible for everyone to achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga traditions.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is the god Yoga. By visualizing the different deities, energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, ideologies, and culture led to the outbreak of countries.
Two years after the war ended, those who were allies are now enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
It was supposed to continue for 40 years and fight seriously, using proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan and Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had completely collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge line.
And like that, these plans became outdated in a day or two, approximately, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties – bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and cargo across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of naval forces was to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, and at the same time, to impede your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the new examples we need to pay attention to was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was primarily using submarines and trying to stop the movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain, just like it did with the rest of Europe.
It's clear that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes still maintain these areas for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or secondary grazing areas, and often herders – who were frequently children or teenagers – grazed them, like the grazing system known now. And grazing methods are still used to this day.
Wagonways built it in England early in the 16th century.
Even though the Arab carriages were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads than those that could travel on the roughest roads during the day.
Bring the crossties a little early to hold the tracks in place. However, they gradually learned that the tracks would be more efficient if there was a piece of iron on top.
It has become a common practice, but iron has caused corrosion to the wooden cabinets of the carts.
Eventually, they replaced the wooden carts with iron carts. And in 1767, they built the first complete railways.
The first modes of transportation that were known were walking. People started walking upright a million or two years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning the upright human).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, usually didn't walk upright.
We found bipedal adaptations in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, while the coastline could have been walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more friendly way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
This is exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and address them.
It's clear enough that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advancement of humanity, and problems have become greater due to population growth and the expensive lifestyle of humans.
After its approval by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few buildings away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, they produced approximately 150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlop rims."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8th.
They sent a unit to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still available are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten version is not available.
Many paleontologists today are saying that a group of creatures of dinosaurs lived and are still alive today. And those creatures are birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There's a lot about birds that still resembles dinosaurs.
They have legs with measurements and claws, and they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all used computers today rely on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain a single unit value from two values, meaning 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits – to use computer language.
The internal poisoning might not be severe. The symptoms, like vomiting, are general, so we can't make an immediate diagnosis.
We can consider the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals as a key indicator of internal poisoning.
Look at the label and pay attention to it to get the specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
Insect scientists use the term "bed bug" in its formal sense, referring to the group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have greatly adapted to infest humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are cute insects that adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, in approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), it has become the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple might decide it's not in their best interest, or in the child's best interest, to raise him/her.
These couples can choose to create a parenting plan for their children.
In an adoption process, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that the spouses of others can raise the child.
The main goal of science is for us to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This is the method that teaches most people how to do scientific research.
But it's not just about that; it's an experience, and experience is a test we use to get rid of one or more potential hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations, as well as scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's viewpoints were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Usually, many of the recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior depend on the existence and production of internal cycles through biological clocks.
We recorded periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that continue even during free cycling periods and in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to differentiate DNA in the fossils using radioactive phosphorus or sulfur-labeled scavenger protein.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations can only be passed on to children in germline cells, whereas mutations in other places may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities at the site include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of that is visiting orangutans and photographing them and learning about them in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns by car to go to their workplaces, and they see others who are becoming their destination, which is the place they just left.
With these dynamic, back-and-forth commutes, everyone connects to a specific transportation system that relies on and supports private cars.
The science is saying now that this massive carbon economy has displaced a vital ecosystem from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Rarely do you hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do the transportation systems act like this, and why do they fail daily? Don't the transportation engineers understand? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of driver and individual vehicle movement between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are considered difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted 100%.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a somewhat regular and reasonable manner; that's why traffic flow usually has a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented by mathematical equations.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we established relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and friends more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back over their body length.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
For thousands of years, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but a lot of people thought the opposite of that: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense, because you don't feel like the ground is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water that the second largest river carries.
Amazon also shows a river in the world; sometimes its width is six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that they continued to build the pyramids with stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have not been surpassed in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians marveled at the New Kingdom monuments of their ancestors, some of which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the fewest residents.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language that most people use in the state, while they usually use Latin during religious celebrations.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People learned about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times. We can discover them all in nature in their original form, and it's relatively easy to extract them using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
It was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, even though it was also assumed that it transforms into new materials to form what we see.
Nails are basically a mixture of one or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
You can also get spikes containing small amounts of non-mineral elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly small, to the point that trillions of them could fit within the time it takes to reach the end of this sentence.
And like that, the pencil was a good friend to many people when they take it out.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the pencil was neglected to a lesser status and uses.
People are writing messages on computer screens now, without needing a typewriter.
One can't help but ask oneself how the keyboard will adapt when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to gather the nucleus with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Dividing the core again will release a bit of that energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with or without a bit of force.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thin under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible there's more lava nearby because the crust is thin. It would have been easy for the magma to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on researching what makes people like or show interest in something.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they reach puberty.
These theories look into certain people and what makes them want the things they do, and what aspects of their environment led them to do or not do certain things.
The two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, it's possible that two dynamics emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, the person transforms into someone we can't recognize, and feels like they need to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Often, virtual team members act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members, meaning their teams can meet across different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management team where each member is accountable to someone. We set the "invisible team" standards for each member.
Why does she need an organization to go through a lengthy process to establish an educational organization? One of the goals of an application for organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are utilized effectively through the functional departments of any organization, creativity and excellence can emerge.
As a result of this, it's possible that the organization's collaborative effort to overcome an obstacle will lead us to an innovative new process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership needs to create a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides a physical guide for the theoretical approach to investigating consciousness. This expands the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's well known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This will provide us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research will include exploring the creation of machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, in addition to recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial features.
It's become like these things, separate specializations, and those that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Often, artificial intelligence is currently being used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It's also being developed for many computer program applications and home video games.
School trips are a big part of any class. A lot of the time, the teacher wants to take the students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine arts while they're with their class.
Participating in a field trip is almost a nice way to think about how it will reflect on the trip and become a exchange of experiences with future semesters.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina do a website design project about their trip to the state capital every year, and they redesign the website each year, but they keep the old versions online like a scrapbook.
Maybe it could help student blogs improve students' writing as well. Often, students start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, so having an audience changes that in general.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become smarter about the world around them." Feeding the audience's interest makes students intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Note-taking is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to broaden the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "could make students more analytical and critical; by effectively responding to online materials, students can identify their stance on other people's writings and also determine their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and includes a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
In the far south, there are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to natural beauty that isn't being exploited for Moscow or what's behind it.
All of these things, and more, shed light on Ontario as being considered the core of the "foreignness" of being Canadian.
Large areas in the north have low population density, and some are almost uninhabited.
Let's compare the populations, this will surprise many: the African Americans living in the United States are more numerous than the Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest unit, and it's a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Just as the Arabs brought Islam to the land, the matter significantly took hold of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape.
The coast borders the area from the north, and the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Woman: It's advisable for any traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to follow or grab someone by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they left it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Badia, and they called it Casablanca. The Spanish merchants who established commercial posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
All around the old city, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather products, shisha, and a full range of ghilao accessories, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In the year 2002, lava from Mount Nyiragongo erupted and destroyed much of Goma's streets, especially the downtown area.
Even though Ghumayri is relatively safe, we still need to look for any visits outside of Ghumayri to understand the ongoing conflict in the northern Kifwe region.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use Boda Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Ghuma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Because they couldn't reach it, "Timbuktu" became used as a passage to distant and strange lands.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stations during Henry Lewis Gates' PBS series "Africa: Wonders of the World."
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country's cities, because it is characterized by a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The area of the garden is 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which has different wildlife.
It is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered one of the most prominent national parks in South Africa (SanParks).
Just like we do with all the national parks in South Africa, there are maintenance fees and daily entrance fees for the park.
It's also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to a selection of parks in South Africa, or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name, and it's considered the main hub by many tourists.
The procession of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline resembled a shimmering strip, possibly visible through the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of the harbor at the Colon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urbanization is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made a special place for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
We can say that Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangrove forests in the world, and it extends for a distance of 80 km (50 miles) in the remote areas of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Declare Sundarbans a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest portion within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just swamps for mangrove trees—they contain some of the last remaining symbols of the vast forests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, with about a third of it covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are now approximately 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the station between the areas (across the river) all day, although most of them, especially the one going east towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the intercity buses are usually crowded, it's advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by comfortable and durable small Japanese coaster buses.
Service cars are a fast and comfortable way to travel to neighboring places, such as Barou (number 150) and Bunaqa (no. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The towers reach a height of 83 meters, and their length is 378 meters, and they contain two passages, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
It was decided that the bridge would operate at full capacity in September 2017, once they finish with the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was a homeland for other indigenous groups like the Guayaku and Payagu, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was founded, which was previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of the encounter between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year happens in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
You can also watch smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
To get news about championships and where to buy polo match tickets, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can withdraw money at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, across from the AFC West store.
They accept the British Pound everywhere in the islands, and they also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars in many instances.
They might not accept credit cards in remote islands, even though they take British and American currency; therefore, you should ask the owners before you go to determine the accepted payment method.
It's practically impossible to exchange Falklands dollars outside the islands, so exchange your money beforehand before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region. Therefore, in the summer months, the temperatures are above +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the weather colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain stays pretty much the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the garden are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and it's forbidden to feed or disturb them.
According to what the garden authorities say, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may seem, bison, deer, wild goats, bears, and pretty much all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't maintain a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Besides that, you also need to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong odor and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1950s of the 19th century and was the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The port was the site of naval clashes with a bad reputation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 people, including Americans and Germans, perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by Mao's movement, a peaceful gathering was held in the city to assassinate Supreme Leader Tupou Tamasissi Lilofi the Third.
In many beaches, because of Auckland's overlap between two harbors, the most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and swimming is safe there, with most of them having plenty of shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are crowded family beaches at times, with a decent selection of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Raqm Wahid" (Number One), and it's not a complicated beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There's a lot of French wine one could drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be able to transport you better.
The tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but you can easily find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes with a tall mound of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices, despite their high price, are excellent.
There are many trips to the Coral Sea throughout the six months, and injuries resulting from any of these causes in the Coral Sea are rare.
And with that, ask for advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and near river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. And sometimes they can be found outside of those times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind, knowing they'll have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Generally, travel agencies have deals with specific hotels, even though you can find other types of accommodation bookings, like campsites, through the travel agency.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers (to/from the airport), or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or sort out other papers for your trip (like a visa).
Despite that, you need to review any modifications or requests through the travel agent first, not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you have to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Don't forget this, even though the music in the main theaters might have ended, there might be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until a late hour.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in the winter, make sure of the cabin's location, because walking across the ice is due to a large number of people being affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to increase the time and money that customers spend. Usually, the windows and clocks aren't available, and it's difficult to find an exit.
Usually, they have food, drinks, and special entertainment, to keep visitors in a good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places serve alcoholic beverages in the youth districts. However, sugar weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or above mountain passes needs to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, because the friction is low, you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
With snowstorms, a sufficient amount of snow can fall, causing you to get stuck in a very short time.
Visibility might be limited due to snowfall, blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the car windows.

In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, but in other areas it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider filtering the water with sealed bottles from a well-known company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases unfamiliar to their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in a worse case, cause allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infections.

Travelers heading to countries with high taxes at certain times can save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it repeatedly passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: most of the road is steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than they were in the sections before and after – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and strictly adhering to them is more important than anything else.
It's strange that the mobile service is much stronger here than in many other stretches of the road, like Pennsylvania Wilds, for example.
German pastries are really delicious, and Bavaria is very rich and diverse, like what's found in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are well-known; they bake apples with pastries throughout the year, and cherries and peaches appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Traditional cakes are often strongly associated with a strong cup of coffee.

The saddle supports the rider's legs, allowing them to descend on either side of the saddle.
It offers more stability for the rider, but there might be safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting caught.
If the knight falls from the horse and his leg gets caught in the stirrup, he might get dragged if the horse runs far away. To reduce these risks, some safety precautions can be taken.

Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a lot of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across different countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks many times.
And with that, the Schengen area is like almost one country in terms of this reputation.
As long as you stay in this region, in general, you can cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
And importantly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas for each member state of the Schengen area separately, thus saving time, effort, and paperwork.
There's no comprehensive definition for manufactured things that are considered masterpieces. Some tax agencies say goods that are over 100 years old are considered masterpieces.
The definition includes geographical variations, meaning the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
It's possible to present handicrafts as treasures, even though they are smaller than the mass-produced items they resemble.
Raising reindeer is considered an important source of livelihood among the Samaritans, and also the culture related to trade is important for many other professions.
Even from a traditional perspective, despite that, not all Semites were widely involved in reindeer herding, and they lived off fishing, hunting, and things like that, and most of them were animal herders.

Search operations at security checkpoints became much more frequent after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals must not be subjected to scans before surgery that compromise their privacy and dignity.
Tides and currents are the flow back from the waves that break on the beach, mostly near coral reefs or something similar.

The Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by more than one country and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active units in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Arabian Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Among other places is Livingston Island, and Deception Island, which was engulfed by a caldera of an active volcano and gave us a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Arabian Peninsula here merge with the plateau, then reappear to form the El Sourth mountain range, which is 360 km long. The Minisota Glacier River runs through it.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains on the Antarctic continent, the Vinson Massif, with a summit height of approximately 4892 meters in Vinson Mountain.

Finland is a nice place for boats. "The land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands too, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Despite the coastal archipelagos and large lakes being big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, and a boat can fit seven or eight people.
He's like this in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in a different way – he's completely unique (like in the Netherlands, for example, the numbers go from one to forty).
Most Baltics tours are characterized by a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for two full days and return and sleep on the boat at night.
If you go to the beach only using sightseeing tours on boats, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
In a few of the cruises, Berlin, Germany appears in the brochures. As you saw on the map above, Berlin doesn't have a place close to the sea, and visiting the city isn't included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't traveled before or have experienced a traumatic event.

The straightforward way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large amount to get an upgrade (or better, have your company do it for you instead).
In any case, this isn't cheap: as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay roughly four times the regular economic fare for businesses, and 11 times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Do airlines know that there's a specific core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of having quick and comfortable access, and they pay for that?
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is used more widely.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Transnistria Republic, which declared itself unilaterally in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but no member state of the United Nations recognizes it.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million people, and it's the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

Please remember, if you would, to visit the mass grave site, in addition to the site of a meaning of God that we can hardly count for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women are still living from those who survived it, and many others have loved ones who were killed or had to work until they died—Jews and non-Jews alike.
I hope you treat the site with all the dignity, respect, and decorum it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't deface the site by putting marks or scratching the writing on the walls of the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of them prefer to speak Catalan, and most of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.

Similarly, they ask men to wear pants that cover the knees.
It might be possible to borrow it from the storage near the entrance, but these dishes aren't washed after each user, so it might not be comfortable to wear them. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisine of other Mediterranean coastal regions, relies on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple, traditional summer meal is usually: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any spices available, like cheese and tuna, and other things.
You always start all nouns, on the side with the word "you" for you, with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.

Because light pollution wasn't at its peak like it is today, they are usually found in cities and universities, and it's easier to reach them than those built in the new era.
Most of the new research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with suitable weather conditions.
We see the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, which are part of Japanese culture from the 8th century.
This concept came from China, and the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the Emperor along with other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Palace.

Often, traditional churches organize a service on Holy Saturday night during the Easter holiday, and often worshippers come to celebrate the midnight service to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals couldn't make the journey, leaving the giant tortoise as the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in the winter, you'll experience the polar night, meaning the sun won't rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be darker or lighter than usual around the clock.
Because the areas have few inhabitants, light pollution isn't really considered a big problem many times, so you'll also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are just regular work clothes, and colleagues call each other by their family names or job titles.
Collaboration in the workplace is very important, because it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
They have to get the workers' approval from their bosses a lot of the time on any decisions they make, and they expect them to follow their bosses' instructions without question.
