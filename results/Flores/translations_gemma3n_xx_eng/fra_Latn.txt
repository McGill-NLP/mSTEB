This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides details that fossils can usually not offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brown-chestnut on the upper side and pale or carotenoid in color on the underside.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, but instead display other characteristics specific to feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists clarify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, and not a young one.
A booby-trapped car exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work performed was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Andromeda Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is found in a sort of halo and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the agents verified his identity, the voter drops the ballot in the ballot box and signs his voter card.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she achieved a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
Her other event, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish in tenth place in the seated women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes less than Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
In the sitting women's skiing category, four skiers failed to finish their course; regarding the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race did not manage to place.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, stated that the accused had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is being held in pre-trial detention while awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimonies could be compromised because her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Among the other topics discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years following the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to agree to a period of five years.
The test subjects in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim parks and heritage conservation manager at NPWS, the four designated shooters for the first culling campaign were duly trained and briefed on safety procedures.
Martelly appointed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth decree under Article 85 of the Constitution in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating in faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had become aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
An ex-police officer in the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was devastated.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders ("black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me… or even weirder… I love her and I'm going to miss her… I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it was prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various equipment and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic material for Earth, which can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "gossip and political nonsense."
It is thought that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, and not on ground-based radar systems previously used, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There is no additional transport, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transportation led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to take much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant finch with a conical beak, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny coins.
It can be drawn into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That's what we call the pH of a chemical product. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The red cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the tested chemical product.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with flushing mechanisms in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then relays it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is making transportation much simpler and faster.
That brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below are smaller felines that eat similarly sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
Furthermore, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that prey on the much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
The prides are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families often consisting of many sisters and daughters.
Lion troops behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's deep roar, but rather like a sentence whose words are shouts and growls.
Ocelots have a taste for small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find their food (prey) using their sense of smell, by sniffing out their trail on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expire).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time; it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, so that nothing in its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it's possible it was a deceptive predator. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible it was cannibalistic.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for him.
Although the Romans consumed foods we are familiar with, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, as well as the dormouse, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to organize banquets together where they reclined on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin, which were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Some pyramid-shaped towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Most of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were nothing more than open stalls facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is recounted that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and discovered Greenland – naming it so – while traveling further west.
However, independent of their discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country is considered "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" could be read. The text is at the bottom of the document, printed on the reverse side.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage in its existence, the large parchment (which measures approximately 29 and three-quarters inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
Therefore, it is probable that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by the French of Vichy, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupant instead of resisting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A cultural civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—the Congress being its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the power to deviate from tax laws or those on customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the archipelago that it comprises, Japan is often designated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The earliest information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been rebuilt to offer tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the era of analog films.
It's still manufactured today, but what's important is that its aspect ratio is inherited from the image format of digital camera sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, and it's quite disconcerting, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often poorly applied and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that fosters dynamism while also providing protection for the image.
He indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are specifically there for this reason.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over 1000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted and codified international law by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime zones, thus posing a threat even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic had only elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place among many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political repercussions, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, as the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended this worldly life. He had a habit of frequenting a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived from that era, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, groups together several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The "push" symbol looks like a V, and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
The top means you should start at the tip and draw the bow, and the bottom means you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Drawing the bow upwards generally produces a softer sound, while drawing the bow downwards is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own markings in pencil, but don't forget that printed bow markings are for musical effect and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women vendors.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period in European history spanning the 11th to 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself unfolds according to a process that largely transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which drives the invention of new techniques in healthcare to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to that geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the world's fashion capital today, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until approximately 1100.
Its status declined during the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western modes could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using conserved seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share similar ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or sex of their members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children have been locked away by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children was due to the rejection by their parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When children are entirely raised by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a learning method, but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new teaching approach, such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a professor is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to query, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a very diverse range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn't stimulating, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We view the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is to say, facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, notably, that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause the variations between the two populations to alternate with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant-based resources most readily available would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-sourced food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible while providing a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to how savanna chimpanzees do it today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and dozing off shortly after (for 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so as to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for being diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace is opposed to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present is. Each person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. It is through the visualization of various deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awakened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep-seated conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the following 40 years and would see real clashes, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was attempting to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the better-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
"Wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to haul heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
Crossrails were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of transportation was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even advocate to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advancements made by humans, and that problems have become more significant due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap sheets of which we still know the existence are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs covered in scales and equipped with claws; they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs, just like head lice, are parasitic, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well decide that it is not in their best interest, nor in the child's best interest, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to pursue an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it's not the only one. Experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, but also to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, particularly the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
One can, for example, go see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small countryside towns by car to get to their workplace and pass other people who are going to work in the countryside that they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in a way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this economy, massively based on carbon, has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was rather about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although it also put forward the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
We also find alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to more rare uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works on the following principle: it converts energy by assembling a nucleus from a multitude of protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill. By splitting the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is approximately 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner over the seas and thicker under the continents.
There may be more mare on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what in their environment prompts them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the group has created up to that point and do things their own way.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between management and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the executive team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to undertake the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals related to the practical application of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively within an organization's functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provides material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. It therefore allows for reducing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors, and brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring an intelligent approach using machines.
Among the examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several domestic computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational experiences. Students can view objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while remaining seated with their class.
Participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet College in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. The site is updated annually, but older versions are kept online as an archive.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often approach blogging with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually leads to improvement.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them." The need to generate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"When used effectively, blogs "can enable students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and express their own viewpoints on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You will find Niagara Falls further south and, to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings, which possess pristine natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more besides, make Ontario what foreigners consider the very essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in itself, when it comes to fauna.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury resorts.
Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands, and the religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at the time when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India, connecting Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman traveling state that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding band (which should not appear too valuable).
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors they consider harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting unwanted advances from men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after having destroyed it rebuilt and baptized it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was later renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and knick-knacks of all kinds, but that's all there is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any trip outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the most affordable gorilla trekking expeditions in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for faraway and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main segments of Henry Louis Gates's PBS show "Wonders of the African World."
The city strongly contrasts with the cities in the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southeastern border.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each harboring a specific fauna.
This is one of the most well-known theme parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship park of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that provides access to certain South African parks, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that outlines the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon located directly across.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers invested in. Thus, it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not, however, composed solely of mangrove swamps: they also hold some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find approximately 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the interdistricts bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, particularly those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived essentially through fishing, hunting, and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish initiated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Furthermore, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to a British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the island's sole bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighboring islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, even though British and US currencies may be. Speak to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it's colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odorous food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tristful naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering held in the city, during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches, as Auckland straddles two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the center of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very crowded with families, have numerous shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is "Number One," a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, "Manta."
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
You can safely drink the tap water locally, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "latte" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are taken throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to stay upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies for other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfer service, or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain any other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any modification or request must, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-located campsite.
Don't forget that even if the musical performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue late into the night at other venues in the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises around the most exposed huts.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found there, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They generally offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment in order to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay.
On some sites, it's the venues that offer alcoholic beverages for free. Nevertheless, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it's crucial to stay sober.
Anyone traveling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you in.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall, blowing snow, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable experience for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion in African territory, and particularly in the savanna, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment allows for good observation of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "foot safari," or "footing") involves hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing damp clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if they aren't in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you can find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals they are unfamiliar with in their region of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in the most serious cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some locations, tax-free shops offer the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections – generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict observance is even more important than before.
However, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are cooked and used in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but generous pastries, try Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "thick" or "thin," depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and certain other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia, comprising 17,000 islands, has an Indonesian cuisine that is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are footrests for the rider, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: indeed, the user's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backward by a rider who is falling.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the heights of the peaks, the panoramic views of the mountains are breathtaking. Climbers from around the world constantly discover new routes to take on the slopes, where possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, particularly skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of gliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: some cave paintings showing skiers date back 5,000 years BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, Nordic skiing, or ski mountaineering.
This resembles alpine ski touring, as well as mountaineering, but generally doesn't incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you'll be able to cover distances a bit greater than on foot – but you'll rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but comprising many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore involves having to submit multiple visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, functions a bit like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control points.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves you time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on the location; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are not as old as similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all the Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, while primarily using reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people practice modern professions. Tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, particularly by non-Roma people, the term "Gitane" is often considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Rom people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your international health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than those of Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous meteorological phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can take many forms depending on the geographical, topographical, and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, just like storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Extreme, regional, and seasonal weather phenomena include cold snaps, blizzards with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to check for weather risks that could affect their destination region, as this may impact the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone considering traveling to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Courses in hostile environments" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A training course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon handling training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender indication (X) or updated documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender individuals in the pre-operative phase should not expect to undergo scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that flow back from waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a strong current towards the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It's also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted or not, you might want to wait for rescue.
The readjustment shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your culture of origin.
At first, when you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is positioned as both the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and possess the largest number of research stations, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston and Deception Islands, where the caldera flooded by a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula blend into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote areas, where there is no cellular network, you may have no choice but to resort to satellite telephony.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
It's a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local phone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken gap year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Generally speaking, there is a registration fee to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is a top destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it's a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea at all, and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no shame in it: it's no different from the personal fears and anxieties that many people experience regarding other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on a lack of control.
Transportation companies are well-compensated for making fast deliveries. Often, in the context of an urgent repair, the issue of deadlines is crucial for the documents, goods, or spare parts involved.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem. (Note: "routes" is translated as "roads" because in this context it refers to routes for transportation/business, not necessarily physical roads.)
If they had shipped goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and unloading.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to spend a large sum of money for this privilege (or, even better, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to try to get discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are very well aware that they can count on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay a premium for speed and comfort, and they set their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million inhabitants, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent hub for connections.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, thriving commercial center, situated around a vast bay, surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one can find interesting marble sculptures representing doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk around this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located north of Lisbon, is easily accessible and became famous among foreigners thanks to the vivid account of its splendor provided by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Heading north, be sure to visit the magnificent Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a world-renowned site for the apparitions of Mary.
Don't forget that you are essentially visiting a charnel house, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jewish or non-Jewish alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes it as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is still to do your best and act like a well-mannered person. This will greatly facilitate your travels.
Parisians' aloofness quickly melts away if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When women visit a monastery, they must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders also covered.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear trousers covering the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and relies on olive oil.
A simple and popular meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever condiments are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, followed by the word "Sie" which means you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
One could also say that it facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" distinctly: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a concern in their time as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other close members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even just "one."
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, taking "specimens" will also get you kicked out without question.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost anything you need once you arrive.
However, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the heat (always) and strong solar radiation (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not only to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often organize an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands did so originally by water, swimming or aboard floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance separating them from the continent, the mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
It's a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for almost the entire day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
The uniforms are classic work attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get their superiors' approval for any decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
