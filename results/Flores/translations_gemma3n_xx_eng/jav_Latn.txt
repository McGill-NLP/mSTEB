This doesn't just confirm that there are dinosaurs with feathers, a widely circulated theory, but mostly there are no fossils that can be used as proof, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
The scientist said that the appearance of this animal fur is brown-beige on top and dull or a carotenoid color on the bottom.
The discovery also guarantees insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed structure called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics—barbs and filaments—researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development from these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that despite this being a juvenile dinosaur, the sample indicates adult feathers and not down.
The researcher provided instructions even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur; the sample indicates adult feathers, not down.

As for the other racer, Slalom Gedhe, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first place Claudia Loesch from Austria and 1:09.02 slower than ninth place Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in a women's group failed to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 ski teams in the Giant Slalom race achieved a ranking.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have apprehended five people who forcibly recruited a Swiss woman and returned her phone and laptop."
The suspects are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjat.
Supervisory Police Officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to court covering their shame.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, everyone was saved.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road was temporarily closed when the accident occurred while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
The younger sibling was arrested because they were at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering their son.
He/She is being detained while awaiting charges and trial, but the witness evidence is also unclear because the image has already been disseminated.
This chapter includes common practice in England, but the way they make guesses about the premises is different in Scotland, and the pre-trial proceedings have witnessed photos that could be damaging.
Guru Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted, "Publishing the photo of the suspect will be very harmful to journalists."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office has told journalists that there will be no further comments made until at least after the indictment.
That document, according to reports that have emerged, will accuse the border issue, desired by Palestine according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
The other topic reported on discussed included the future form of Jerusalem as a sacred place for all nations and matters of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the return of weapons that have been ringing in the valley for ten years after an agreement was reached for the PA to leave them for only five years.
The weeder during the pest control trial must be closely supervised by the supervisor, because this training is monitored and evaluated.
In collaboration with the NSW (Australia) Sports Arbitration Association (Inc.), volunteers who meet the requirements are recruited under the Sports Arbitration Association's outreach program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation received security briefings and foliage training.
Martelly was appointed to the Temporary Election Commission (CEP) yesterday, which had nine members.
This is CEP Kelimane Martelly in four years.
Yesterday, the presidential commission suggested the resignation of the CEO as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The committee is considered Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that began spreading in October.
Occasional protests, sometimes harsh, are triggered by election failures, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods that could not be used due to overheating have been reported, causing six fires and injuring four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that there have been approximately 27 accidents caused by that device.
Last Sunday, METI announced that Apple accused 34 additional incidents of heatstroke, which the company called "not serious."
The aforementioned ministry responded by quoting a report from Apple: "This is indeed worthy of concern."
The earthquake occurred in the Mariana at 07:19 local time this morning (09:19 PM Friday GMT).
The North Mariana emergency management office stated that there were no reported damages in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking a ship in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been released, and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six prisoners, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took the place of an old woman when she (the woman) needed a rest. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in the medical field.
He was trained as a dental surgeon and began working at the National Women's Hospital Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at Liggins Hospital, she researched premature births during her free time.
The study suggests that the given hormone will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators have found two 'black boxes' flight recorders in Rebo.
Friends also pay respect to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna is the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Quite unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is just as strange as me...maybe even more...lovable and I will miss her (woman)...Hopefully she is in a better place."
Out of a total of 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 federal election, the number who disagreed with Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard acknowledged during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.
Those 34 percent who vote are hoping Queen Elizabeth II will become the rightful king in Australia herself.
In the final survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic.
The gold medalist in the Olympics will swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and the three-crown relay in the Commonwealth Games, but their connection to the doubt surrounding their ability is questionable.
I haven't been able to take medicine to cope with the pain since then because it's forbidden in the Competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has found the largest prime number known as of January 25th.
Some people tested the discovery using different software and hardware at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets could be a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists are striving to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because in the past comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a same-sex marriage bill.
He called that rumor "political eating and foolishness."
He was thought to be going to run for president in 2016.
NextGen, the system required by the FAA, will allow aircraft to fly more direct routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to display aircraft with greater accuracy at higher altitudes and provide pilots with more comprehensive information.
There is no additional transportation being implemented, and the train above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The feeling of fear of lacking transportation adds to the opportunity that this game must be done carefully without assistance.
Research published in the journal Ilmu on Thursday reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Research from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reports that a new species can emerge in just two generations, although this is thought to take longer, as seen in the Darwin's finches, Geospiza warblers, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape. It can be rolled into a small shape.
This can be made into a very thin wire, which can be drawn out and buried. It can also be thinned or made into a sheet.
This can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made very thin, especially when used to paint drawings on a book called a "decorated manuscript."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how much acid or, in other words, the alkaline chemical compounds are present.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, damp hands, knead it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will combine with the outer layer, which will make it feel funny and sound like a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a modern waste disposal system.
The remnants of waste disposal systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes a part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is very far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a signal and then reflects it back down, almost immediately.
A satellite is sent to outer space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere deflects some rays and obscures our view.
A very large rocket, 100 feet tall, is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into the sky.
The wheel has changed the world in a good way. The biggest impact is creating easy and fast transportation.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
The forest there has more cats of medium size eating prey of medium size, from rabbits to deer and squirrels.
Ultimately, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat more during the small season, such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The key to success is the concept of position, a unique attribute possessed by each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
A lion is the most social cat, living in a large group called a pride.
This group of lions consists of one to three adult male lions, along with approximately thirty lionesses and cubs.
Female lions usually have close relationships, forming large family groups consisting of female lions and their offspring.
The lion behaves like a pack of wolves or wild dogs, these peculiar animals resembling a lion (but not another large cat) in their behavior, and are also deadly to their prey.
The very smart athlete, that tiger could climb (though not very well), leap, jump far, and roar with the strength of five people.
The tiger is in the same group (Panthera species) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Those four cats are among the ones that can roar.
The leopard's roar is not like the lion's roar, which has a deep sound, but rather like a whisper and shrieking words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch rats, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelot cats track and also find animals to eat (prey) using their scent, marking their territory on the ground.
It can see in the dark with its small eyes, and can also move silently. The ocelot hunts prey by blending in with the shadows and then pouncing on its prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separates from the main population in their place of origin (like if they migrate across a mountain range or river, or if they migrate to a new island where they cannot easily migrate again), they will often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need a different approach or adaptation to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
His original position hasn't changed even a little; he still needs assistance similar to before.
Over time, when the new population began to adapt to its new environment, it started to become invisible and unlike other populations.
Ultimately, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look very different and cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. This speciation includes an insurmountable order and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., waste).
Trees make food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Trees also provide shade.
We make houses from plants and make clothing from plants. Most of the food that is eaten is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator in its time, so it was fearless, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is met with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as additional teeth on the upper palate, meaning there is no way out for anything that obstructs its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that ichthyosaurs had two chambers in their stomach. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have also eaten animals of their own kind.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn't be its match.
Even though all of the food there would be common for themselves, the Romans indeed had some strange or uncommon foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
The difference is that the poor person and the woman eat their food sitting on a stool, while the rich man enjoys eating together wherever he sits, reclining while he eats.
Roman cuisine could not encompass the foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they all don't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, and there is no ancient Roman who ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonian tribe built a main temple for their gods, considered to be the dwelling places of the deities.
People will bring offerings to the gods, and priests will try to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies or festivals.
Every temple has a certain area that opens, and then the place for internal worship can only be accessed by the priests.
Sometimes a special tower bent like a pyramid, called a ziggurat, was built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses are not very important.
Many Jewish families live outside of their homeland.
The woman is doing the harvest in the yard; those stalls are only open with tables displaying goods facing the road. Stones are used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is rarely visited. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for killing people, and while traveling further north, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, no matter how they arrived, the Eskimo people had already been living there at that time.
Even though each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between people, rulers, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the film National Land, you might think the land map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the letter, it is not a treasure map.
It was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the sentence being "Declaration of Independence originally dated July 4, 1776". The writing was scribbled at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it's likely that the notes are only added for labels.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France was not yet liberated.
This was led by Vichy France. It was the French entity that made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked for the colonizers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Only within two weeks, American and French liberated the southern part of France and returned to Germany.
Civilization is a shared custom possessed by a large group of people who live and work together, which is society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning civil; it is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning inhabitant, and "civitas," meaning city or the state of a city, which is how it can potentially determine the scale of society.
The region of that city is a pioneer of the nation. Culture and civilization demonstrate the inheritance of knowledge across generations, the legacy of enduring culture, and its fair dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without historical evidence related to them and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen newly formed states initially established a weak central government—with the Congress as one of its components—under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress lacks the power to levy taxes and, because there is no national executive or judicial body, it relies on the state government, which is often uncooperative, to carry out all of its actions.
This also does not have the authority to raise tax rules and prices between states/regions.
All members of the state must agree on that article before it can be amended, and other state members consider the government to be light because their representatives very often do not get included.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Famous sports include ball games, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, thanks to the participation of Italy in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan controls nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
The existence of island groups in Japan often leads to Japan being frequently called, geographically, an "archipelago" country.
Taiwan was first sighted in the 15th century by European sailors who then named the island Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a trading post in southern Taiwan, which initiated a transformation in the practices of cultivating native seeds and recruiting Chinese laborers for work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and announced Taiwan as a Qing dynasty province in 1885.
In 1895, following the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Many buildings in the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of the origins.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the common photographic image format in the world is 35mm, where it is the dominant film size at the end of the film analog era.
It is still produced today, but what is more important is that the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
35mm is the original, a bit confused, between 36mm and 24mm.
This format aspect (divided into 12 to produce the simplest number match) is therefore called 3:2.
A more common format (for example, the APS family format) is either equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third rule that is most often violated is a simple guideline when creating dynamism while also maintaining a sense of order within the image.
This indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had once become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
More than a thousand years ago, Christianity could unite the European countries despite their different languages and cultures.
This all concerns the power that affects everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to help those in need, and church money is for that purpose.
The central church authority has been to Rome for a thousand years, and this strict concentration of power and money makes many people wonder if this principle has been followed.
As soon as the hostility broke out, the English began naval blockades against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, and secured important military and civilian supplies, even though this siege violates commonly accepted international law as stipulated by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The British installed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the sea territory, endangering neutral ships.
Because there is a limited response for this plan, Germany expects a response similar to an unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, the actions taken by citizens and nationalists were to resist war and also isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelty of the World War I, countries wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting eras; each period of China or each powerful family had its own distinct dynasty.
Also among every dynasty, there was a period of instability in the divided provinces. The most famous period of this time was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
This happened during a fierce war when many noble families fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with countless people dying fighting for power and control of the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There was a very significant influence from social and political conditions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to all people, not just to a single leader.
Also after the Revolution, the job was opened to all applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful people to achieve results.
The regulations that apply to the military are because military rank is a substitute for the basis of their current class, which is based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in worldly matters. He often went to a cave now known as the Hira Cave on Mount Noor (light) for meditation.
He was in a cave alone, safe at that time, providing a very clear picture regarding Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located at the peak of one of the mountains on the north side of Mecca, this cave is very quiet from the outside world.
In truth, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists. Meanwhile, deep within the cave, it is total isolation.
There is nothing to explore except the beautiful sky, clear above, and many mountains surrounding it. Few parts of this world can be seen or heard from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, has several pyramids (where the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the large Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The "upward arrow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "downward arrow" symbol looks like the inside of a staple or a box missing its bottom side.
The meaning is that you must start from the top and pull the rope, and the meaning of going down is that you must start from the frog (where your hand holds the rope) and pull the rope.
The curve above this notation usually produces a smoother sound, and the checkmark above this notation usually produces a louder and more forceful sound.
Don't just write on your own sign, but remember the curved sign because of the music, so it is usually to be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Marie Theresa was 11 years old and Louis Charles was four years old), and the King's female relatives, Madame Elizabeth, who was a widow, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, he returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and chanting "incim-incim" to the King and Queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of their grand carriage.
At a certain point, there was a member of the celebratory gathering, a court official, who was executed in Versailles before a grieving queen.
The cost of the war against American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
He was forced to pay taxes to the colonial U.S. government to cover the large national debt and floating interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Surely, the great profit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will become the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of that order.
The period when ordinary events were called the High Middle Ages is a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were flanked by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 according to convention.
Technological determination is a statement showing a lot of thought for practice, from technological support or technology that should exist to a strong feeling that human destiny is supported by thoughts that form the basis of connection to scientific rules and their manifestation for technology.
Generally, interpretations regarding technological determinism have two common views: that technological development follows a course that is typically not influenced by cultural or political factors, and that the technology has a "uniform" effect on society, rather than being shaped by social conditions.
Suppose someone will say that machine will be the beginning to build a road.
However, the national road network is not suitable for an economy limited to only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning a large number of vehicles also causes more accidents on the roads, which creates new techniques for repairing damage and fixing damaged car bodies.
The Romantic literary style has many elements of cultural determinism, exemplified by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerge, and this, in accordance with the community's place, is better than imposed laws that are arbitrarily enforced.
Because Paris is known as the fashion capital of the current era, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of Europe in ancient times.
It was famous for being a sophisticated and expensive tool, roughly from 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
Their status was rejected in the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with goods like silk and spices that were more expensive than what was demanded by the Byzantine market.
At that time, the relocation of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was carried out.
Gothic style is said to have peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and again in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style in the west could fall behind by 25 to 30 years.
The European Middle Ages in the West were nearing their end, starting to develop their own style. One of the results of the changes that occurred in this era was the result of the Crusades, when many people began to use needles to fasten clothes.
Sustainable agriculture is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Living sustainably is an easy way, often organic, using original seeds stored for the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or an easy way to increase yields.
Generally, many farmers are involved in agriculture for their livelihood, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Cultural branches make a person with similar thoughts feel unregarded by social status and can cultivate a sense of identity.
Cultural branches can be differentiated based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The quality that determines a cultural branch is often language, aesthetics, or factors related to religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of cultural branches often indicate their membership by using different and symbolic styles, including clothing, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight cases where disadvantaged children, often overlooked, are intentionally abused and not consulted by adults when they are young.
Children like that are called "wild" or naughty. Some "wild" children are locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, these children are abandoned due to the parents' rejection of severe intellectual or physical disabilities of the child.
That naughty child may have been abused when they were little or felt afraid before being abandoned or before leaving.
Others were thought to be carried by animals; some are said to live independently in the wild.
When cared for by non-human beings, the child exhibits wild behavior (within certain limits) almost like animal care, especially feelings of fear and also indifference towards humans.
When the learning is based on a project, it should make learning easier and more engaging, the scaffolding is moved a step further away.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather assistance that provides support for people with new learning experiences, such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also a tiny paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and aimed at prompting, asking, and explaining procedures that can challenge students to manage independently.
Those children live in Foster Care for various reasons, such as being neglected, abused, and also forced (into something).
There are no children who will definitely grow up well in an environment lacking care and education, but they do so anyway.
We feel that the Foster Child Protection System has become a safe zone for these children.
A solid sanctuary must provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent guidance, and trustworthy spiritual mentors.
A caregiver must fulfill all the needs that are lacking in the house, which are taken from the children before.
The internet combines elements of group and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics on the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous connectedness" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has yielded important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, changes in facial expressions occurring in fractions of a second.
Specifically, it is stated that there is someone who can identify if a deceiver is accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article for the President's Review, explains how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still express their true feelings accurately.
He even accuses as if it's a result of good fortune during negation, that human actions can also be possessed by animals like cows and buffaloes.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic types: domesticated and wild.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection eliminates it from the revealed variation pool.
Random mating and recombination occur alternately between two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
What's more, the feeling of failure like that truly leads to serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest accessible plant-based resources are proteins that can be easily obtained from leaves and legumes, but these plants are very difficult to digest by primates like humans unless they are cooked.
Firstly, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high-quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
After being weighed, one shouldn't be surprised if one's ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is a process that intentionally interrupts your normal sleep cycle and you don't fall back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a slightly loud alarm that can make you aware without startling you.
If you find yourself rearranging the clock on your bedside table, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
The choice based on another biorhythm is to drink a lot of water (especially water or tea, known to help flush out a lot of toxins) before sleeping, forcing the body to sweat.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension within their body and mind.
I have completed my coming-of-age ceremony, and I am grateful for the strength of life that exists. Everyone can find peace and true happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. One of the topics on the path of seeking enlightenment is the tension and negativity that we ourselves possess.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but it has developed through the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and through various Yoga practices from India.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhist teachings is very simple. This teaching includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path to embrace all feelings of love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathwork, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Dewa Yoga. Through visualizing various deities, energy is purified, chakras are revitalized, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was an allied enemy in World War II, fostering cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the collapse of nations.
With the end of the war two years ago, former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
This will exist for the next 40 years and will be fought for with friends, by the ruling army, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had collapsed, and one of the proposals was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan was made that night, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian soldiers after fiercely attacking the eastern Polish territories following the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, all bilateral and multilateral.
Using a ship to transport goods is the most effective way to move a large number of people and goods across the sea.
Naval operations traditionally aim to ensure your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, but at the same time, disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy examples from this is the North Atlantic military operation for World War II. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
With the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to halt the advance.
If the Allies fail, Germany might still be able to defeat England, like the rest of Europe.
Sheep were domesticated for the first time roughly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient culture and tribes used to maintain [things] to easily find ways to get milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Sheep are generally kept in groups of animals that graze on hills or other areas, often guarded by shepherds who are usually children or teenagers, similar to commonly known shepherding practices. This herding method is still used to this day.
The cart road was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon's railway is only made up of aligned wooden planks, it can make the harnessed horse pull the wagon faster and haul heavier loads than on a somewhat rough road.
Railway sleepers are known to initially hold the rails in place. However, over time, it is understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but it causes more wear and tear on the wooden wheel parts of the cart.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, rails made entirely of iron were first introduced.
The earliest known vehicles were moving, and humans have been walking upright for two million years with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright human).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright every day.
Bipedalism in the foot bones was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus could walk bipedally quite quickly seven million years ago.
We can start living in a simpler way for the environment, we will be able to join environmental movements, and we can even become leaders in reducing emissions in the future to some extent.
This is merely symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want temporary solutions, then we must find the root causes, and we must eliminate them all.
It is quite clear that the world has become more crowded due to the advancement of human knowledge and technology, and problems have become even bigger because of the excess population and the wasteful lifestyle of humans.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4th, a draft of the text was engrossed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and then sent many blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, and are now known as "Dunlap leaflets".
The first reading of the general text of the document was by John Nixon on the lawn of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which was read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 leaflets of Dunlap that are still being circulated are copies of the complete document. The original handwritten copy is no longer available.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are living today. We call them birds.
Many people call this animal not a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many parts of birds that look like dinosaurs.
He has feet with scales and claws, he hops, and walks on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers currently are based on information manipulation created with code in the form of binary numbers.
Twin digits can have a ranking of only one or two, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called twin digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
Poisoning from within may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms are like common vomiting, so a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The most visible sign of internal poisoning is the presence of open medicine containers or household chemicals containing poison.
Check the label for the first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term for animals is used by entomology experts in formal knowledge for this group of insects.
This word comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which is an insect highly adapted to be a human parasite.
The killer and the two bedbugs are altricial, an adaptation to living in the litter or house of their host.
In the United States, there are less than 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that have been identified, making it a well-known neurological disease for middle-aged adults and young people.
MS is a disorder that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
The couple can decide whether for the sake of their desired interests, or for the sake of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples are allowed to choose what plan to make for their child's adoption.
In a certain adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that their child may possibly become the child of another couple.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works using the scientific method. This method truly guides the most scientific research.
It's not just that, experiments and trials are methods used to discard one or more hypotheses that might occur, generate questions, and also guide scientific research through observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers examine ancient writings, especially the Gospel in Latin.
Aristotle's perspective is applicable to all fields of science, including psychology.
When Greek knowledge declined, the Western world broke free from the influence of Greece with scientific and philosophical rigor.
Many observations of rhythm in physiology and frequent actions heavily depend on the presence of the endogenous cycle and its production via the biological clock.
Periodic rhythm, not just a response to external periodic phenomena, has been proven accurately for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to run free-running time even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main factors proving that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage, or virus, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
He/She made a test using two indicators to mark DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, meaning the genetic material affected and the cells affected are stem cells.
However, mutations within the cells of multicellular organisms that can be passed on to offspring, and mutations in other locations can cause cancer or cell death.
Leisure based on nature can attract many people who want to have fun in nature with the goal of observing scenery, including trees and wildlife.
Examples of low-impact activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting gardens and studying ecosystems.
For example, visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the ancestors in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by motorbike to their workplaces and meet people who work in that small town.
In this dynamic transportation to and from home, everyone wonders how they can connect and support a transportation system based on private cars.
Current knowledge indicates that this massive carbon economy is rejecting the biosphere from one of the most resilient countries that has supported human survival for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. However, everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause people to complain? Why does the system fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental issue?
Traffic flow is a lesson about the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with one another.
It's really frustrating to learn about traffic rules because drivers are often inconsistent.
Luckily, the drivers tend to act consistently; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have a harmony that can be understood and can be proven mathematically.
To illustrate better traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main conditions: (1) density, (2) congestion, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in creating plans, designing, and operating highway facilities.
That creature is among the most agile flying animals. Its strength for flying can help it easily get away from enemies and find food and mate more easily.
Mostly, insects benefit from their ability to cling with their hind legs while attached to something.
This provides him/her a safe place to hide from predators from various small locations.
Now, the insects that can't cling back to their nests are only the tokiyik and the tokiyik flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around Srengenge.
Many people think he is free, but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System orbits the Earth, including Srengenge (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because the earth doesn't feel like it's changing, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It can carry more water than the second largest river eight times over.
Amazon is also the largest river in the world, with an area of six million square kilometers.
The majority of 20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of the planet to the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though building pyramids using stone was continued until the completion of the Old Palace, the Great Pyramid of Giza never surpassed its size and the ingenuity of its construction methods.
The people of Krajan Anyar, Egypt, were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were still beautiful even after a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the fewest residents.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also a language used by many people who work in this area, and Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the people who live in the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they could all be found in nature in their original form and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, created a theory that everything in the universe is formed by a mixture of four elements. Namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
This is almost the same as the four states of matter (in the same way): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also considers them to transform into new matter to form what we observe.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly, there are also metals like iron and gold.
You too can have an alloy that has a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is very small, so billions of atoms can fit in a period at the end of this sentence.
Then, that pencil is a good friend for many people when they are out.
Indeed, when a new writing method emerged, the pencil was downgraded to a shorter state and usage.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, never needing to come closer to get closer.
People can only think about what happens to a typewriter when a newer one arrives.
Nuclear fission occurs based on the principle that energy is required to combine many protons and neutrons in a nucleus.
It's like trying to push a heavy cart uphill. Separating the core and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that these atoms tend to break apart with little or no external force.
The Moon is made of stone and pumice. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the marsh and thicker below the mountains.
It's possible there is more lava on that side because the crust is thinner. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory becomes central to discovering what makes people choose or be attracted to something.
The theory posits that people have specific needs and/or desires that have already been internalized when they enter adulthood.
These theories observe what is related to specific people who are motivated by what they want and what circumstances in their environment will cause them to act or not act in a certain way.
The most famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, the pain of action can be seen when a manager starts leading his/her old comrades. One of the peaks of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the (male) friends" (or the female friends).
This type of manager struggles to make bold decisions, take responsible actions, appreciate employees, delegate tasks, and listen to people's opinions.
On another level of the spectrum, one morpheme becomes an unrecognized individual who feels that he (male) or she (female) must change everything that has been done by the group and make it their own.
However, a leader has absolute responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This action often creates a gap between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams have advantages similar to conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often become a point of contact for nearby physical groups.
He often has more autonomy than regular team members because his price can be found with various regions and times that may not be understood by local administrators.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The unseen team is the management team where each member reports. The unseen team sets standards for each member.
Why is there a gathering wanting to go through a process to establish a gathering of teaching? One of the goals of implementing the concept of learning gatherings into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively in all functional areas of the organization, creativity and excellence can occur.
Consequently, the process of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process to serve the needs of subscribers.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and also be able to acquire knowledge and learning methods within the organization itself.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a practice used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides real evidence for how to prove the examination theory of consciousness. Because the examined areas are becoming smaller and clearer.
The connection between brain health and supportive actions helps scientists to research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause the relapse of some mental functions.
New technology allows us to see and study the structure and processes in the brain that were previously unknown.
This also provides us with a lot of information and material to build a replica model that can help us understand how our minds work.
Although Al has a strong connotation from science fiction, it has created a very important branch for computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and smart adaptation within a machine.
The research focuses on AI, except for creating automated machines that require intelligent actions.
Examples include control, planning and formulation, prevention to answer diagnosis and customer questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
That one has become a different kind of scholarly discipline, focused on providing solutions to life's problems in their true form.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, machinery, and entertainment, because they are built into many household computer devices and gaming applications.
Field trips are an important part of school. Usually, teachers will take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or marvel at the beautiful use of rice fields with their class.
Sharing field trip experiences is also a way to illustrate a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about trips to the State Capital. Every year the website is updated, but the old version remains online so it can be used as a reference book.
Blogs can also inspire and improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers usually changes that.
Because students often become the most enthusiastic audience for criticism, the blogger started trying to add writings so that they would not be criticized.
It also creates a blog "to motivate students to be smarter about the world around them." The need to satisfy the desire to understand new things from these guests inspires students to be eager and enjoy (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and supports students in expressing their learning well, beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more interested in researching and critiquing; by actively responding to online material, students can determine their position on other people's writing and explain their own insights on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is an attractive capital city of Canada, and it offers bilingualism and a collection of art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
To the south, there's Niagara Falls, and to the north, there are undeveloped natural beauties from Muskoka and so on.
All of this and more highlights what Ontario is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
The large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and there are some large forests that are almost untouched.
For comparison of populations that surprises many people: African Americans living in America outnumber the population of Canada.
The islands in East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.

The meaning of rejecting a man is, and don't be afraid to set boundaries in your place (culture or not, it can't make things better!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century AD and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese damaged that building and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake of 1755.
