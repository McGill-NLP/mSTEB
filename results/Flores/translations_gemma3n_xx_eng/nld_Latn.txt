This not only proves the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the vertebral column was likely a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, or vertebral column, but did possess other feather characteristics – such as barbules.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for appearance. Researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this creature actually shows adult feathers and is therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite it being from the tail of a young dinosaur, the creature had the feather coat of an adult and not the down of a chick.

In France, voting has traditionally required very little technology: voters go into a booth and deposit a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope indicating who they are voting for.
Officials first check the voter's identity. Then, the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voter registry.
The process is relatively precisely outlined in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that no envelopes are inside at the beginning of the voting process and that only envelopes from registered and authorized voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's group for the sitting slalom were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish woman's rapists have been arrested and her mobile phone and laptop have been found.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may be unreliable because her story has been widely published.
This is standard practice in the rest of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least not until charges have been brought.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute resolution mechanism, something the Palestinians have long desired based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics that were discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years following the signing of an agreement. However, the PA is only willing to agree to a presence of five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was being followed, and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters received comprehensive safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new provisional electoral council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved five CEPs in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Election Commission. This is part of a package of measures to ensure new elections in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have been taking place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the lack of elections, some of which had been due to take place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported. In total, this led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
"Very regrettable," was the ministry's reaction to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management bureau stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
Additionally, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning in effect.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including children, elderly people, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was ultimately shot.
Liggins went into medicine and followed in his father's footsteps.
Trained as a midwife, he started working in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When he worked in the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs in babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even fellow fighters paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels stated that 'Luna was just as strange as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the survey participants supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while at the other end, 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain because it is banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of the water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are formed. They especially want to know how Earth came to be, given the fact that it has been a very long time since comets collided with it.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and gossip."
It is speculated that he wants to run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system could allow aircraft to take shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel annually and leading to lower carbon emissions, according to the FAA.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, in contrast to older ground radar technologies, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately and providing pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport will be deployed, and no above-ground trains stop at Wembley; furthermore, the parking lots and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A potential lack of transport meant that the chances of the match being played behind closed doors and without supporters increased.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science concerned the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossbreeding of a native Darwin's Finch, the Medium Ground Finch, with an immigrated Cactus Ground Finch, the Española Ground Finch, took longer.
Gold can be worked into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
After it has been made very thin, it can be glued onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You are already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Subsequently, the color of the charcoal juice changes based on the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
The pH value is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance that was tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewage residue has been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, toilets already existed in China, Egypt, and Persia in ancient times. For example, during the Roman period, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women gathered together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the spacecraft receives the call, it is immediately relayed back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has incredibly changed the world. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are cat-like creatures of average size among those that eat prey of average size, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Furthermore, there are many small cats (such as feral cats kept as pets) that hunt larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special role that every cat has, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are family members and also have up to thirty females and pups.
Normally, the women are closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves almost identically to a pack of wolves or dogs – animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, leap long distances, and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar with all its might like a lion. It's more like it growls a whole sentence.
Ocelots' favorite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark using night vision and move very discreetly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the larger population from which they originated (for example, by migrating over a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies appear, so the new population must behave differently or adapt in order to withstand the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population hasn't changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also started to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Through photosynthesis, plants obtain their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone, except for other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws held more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the roof of his mouth, meaning nothing or anyone could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even members of its own species.
In water bodies, nothing was safe from his attacks; even gigantic dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Additionally, there was another difference: poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but wealthy men preferred to hold banquets together where they lounged on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity did not contain any food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They, for example, did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was considered the dwelling place of that god.
Offerings were made to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a rear hall that was accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Jewish family largely took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants at the time. According to Norwegian legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his westward voyage, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, royal families, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different from each other.
Perhaps after watching the film National Treasure, you think there's a treasure map hidden on the Declaration of Independence.
That, however, is based on a misunderstanding. There is something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence, the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776' are written. The text is printed upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was once rolled up for storage.
It seems the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, northern France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French liberated Southern France in just two weeks. Then they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin *civilis*, which means civil or civic, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin *civis*, which then means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state; and that also defines, in a certain way, the scale of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, and are therefore not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial authority, and relied on state authorities to implement all decisions, which often refused to cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to disregard tax laws and rates between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government seriously, which meant their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as an 'island nation'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed along the island and named it Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base of operations, where the VOC disrupted indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which sovereignty over Taiwan was transferred to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built from three major structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the standard film format at the end of the analog film era.
These are still produced to this day, although it was primarily the image ratio that the digital camera's image sensor adopted.
Strangely enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio at this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would then be 3:2.
Many common aspect ratios (for example, APS-like aspect ratios) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes an image dynamic yet also clear and easy to understand.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite language differences and differences in customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church therefore has financial resources for this purpose.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to supply vital resources to military personnel and civilians. However, this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law established in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, making large parts of the ocean impassable to ships, even posing a danger to neutral vessels.
Due to the limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations adopted a stance of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only four cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Even between the various dynasties, there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
There were fierce wars taking place at that time between various nobles who were fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period stands out as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had significant social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism and nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were available to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the military. Military ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Mohammed engaged intensively with otherworldly matters. He often went to a cave for contemplation that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountain Range of Nur.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, offers a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the northern side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even though it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, there is complete isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and belongs to the numerous large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Pyramids of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tribute to the women and family members of Khufu.
The up-bow symbol looks like a V, and the down-bow symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means you should start at the point and push the iron away. Below means you should start at the bow (the place where your hand holds the iron) and pull the iron towards you.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, whereas a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your personal markings, but don't forget that the printed hyphens are there for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
A group of market women accompanied the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by cheering and threatening crowds who threatened the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism concerning the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the people of the Philippines.
They were levied to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance a large portion of the costs, and the interest on the bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism largely rested on the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must know the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The period in which this occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages. These were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which typically ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from the supply of technology or technological imperative to a strict feeling that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general assumptions: the development of technology follows a trajectory that extends largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
Some people will say, for example, that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread car ownership also leads to a greater number of accidents on the road, and this drives the development of new techniques in healthcare to be able to repair the human body.
A large part of cultural determinism was incorporated into Romanticism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known from approximately 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The power of the empire declined in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the west lagged by 25 to 30 years, however.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the most significant developments was a result of the Crusades: people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Agriculture aimed at a livelihood is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses stored seed that originates from the ecoregion, and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yields.
Previously, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms are brought together. This gives them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves through the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often display their group affiliation through a specific symbolic style in their clothing, behavior, and the jargon they use.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization were the few regrettable cases of children who, due to neglect, adversity, or deliberate abuse during their upbringing, were not socialized by adults.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Neglectful children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that some were raised by animals, and it is said that some lived only in the wilderness.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal it cared for (within physical limits), such as fear or indifference towards people.
Project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool to support individuals facing a new learning experience, for example, a new computer program or those starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and physical. A teacher is, for example, a form of support, but the little paperclip figure from Microsoft Office is too.
There is a virtual scaffolding in place that is built into the software, which asks questions, offers memory aids, and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without assistance.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where people don't care about them, and where they cannot develop, yet this happens.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The intention is for foster care to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are being combined.
The diverse characters of the internet lead to new dimensions regarding the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialization' are, for example, proposed as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that no one can recognize a lie by simply paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Through mutation, new genetic variation is added; through selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation is achieved between the two groups through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can survive on the savanna but has difficulty obtaining the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found there.
Furthermore, failing to take this into account can have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately even death.
The easiest plant-based sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of protein that includes all essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees solve this problem on the savanna today.
Sleep disruption means waking up for a reason during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm that brings you back to consciousness without immediately waking you up fully.
If you turn off your clock while you're asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on your body's natural rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a known diuretic). This will require you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of stress someone carries in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the existing life force. Every person is capable of achieving contentment and complete peace.
Everyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the practice of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (energy of enlightenment) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the US came about. When the war ended, conflicts between system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out with each other.
The former allies stood directly opposite each other two years after the end of the war; this marked the beginning of the Cold War.
The war was expected to last 40 years, and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
The Polish defense troops held out until September 17, 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were quickly outdated one night when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Goods transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy's task is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to do so.
The US attempted to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy tried to block this traffic simultaneously using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Great Britain probably would have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began raising them so they could always easily obtain their meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing land. They were then guarded by goat herders, just like the more well-known sheep herder often had a child or younger person with them. Nowadays, they are still herded in the same way.
Already in the 16th century, horse railways were being built in England.
Although horse railways consisted only of a rail of planks, the horses still had to run faster and pull larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult-to-travel roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used relatively early on to keep the rails in place. However, it gradually became clear that rails would be more efficient if an iron spike were present on top.
This quickly became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years. Sahelanthropus may have also walked on two legs seven million years ago, incidentally.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, or even take action to somewhat alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it's just like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify and eliminate the root cause of the problems.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly profoundly changed the Earth. Moreover, overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8th in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a dinosaur species still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of a dinosaur.
On their legs they have claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data that is encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers that are used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open medicine boxes or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This insect group is formally called 'true bugs' by entomologists.
This term originates from an ancient association with bedbugs, which are insects that are very good at parasitizing humans.
Both red assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound; they have adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the chance of getting MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These parents can choose to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the primary goal of science. This method serves as the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it's about more than just pilot studies; a pilot study is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, raise questions, and make observations, serving as a guideline for scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West increasingly failed to understand Greek philosophy and science as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle through a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the phage protein was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are heritable. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cancer to develop.
Nature tourism attracts people who enjoy visiting natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On-site, one can hunt, fish, take photographs, observe birds, visit parks, and study the ecosystem, among other activities.
An example is a visit to, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars in one way or another.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy means the biosphere is no longer in a stable state, which allowed human evolution to occur over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely encountered in comparison.
How is it that so many complaints arise with transport systems, why does it go wrong daily? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In traffic flow analysis, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points are examined, as well as the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to investigate traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows exhibit a degree of consistency and that something can be said about this from a mathematical point of view.
Connections have been established between the three core characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
With the help of those relationships, the planning, design, and operation of civil engineering infrastructure are facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places from predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people actually believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and that the Sun did too (as well as other stars).
This sounds reasonably logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river, and it carries more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth and in some places has a width of six miles.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unmatched in terms of size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then already more than a thousand years old.
Approximately 800 residents live in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language of official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they can all be found in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know from the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. There are, of course, also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is built from matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a loyal companion for many people when it was launched.
As newer writing methods have emerged, the pen has unfortunately declined in status and is now used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You might wonder what will happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like you're pushing a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus is split again, a portion of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the Moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more flaws on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could more easily reach the surface there.
Content theories aim to find out what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they aim to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
Generally, two approaches emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to position themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, delegate, and hold people accountable for their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and wants to claim everything as their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a divide between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams should meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, although there may be minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The "invisible team" also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity emerge when all available resources within an organization's functional departments are effectively utilized.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
To enable innovation within an organization, management must foster a culture where innovating, shared knowledge, and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. This allows the research area to be narrowed and more precise data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
Because there are increasingly more new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that will give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior falls under AI research.
Some examples are administration, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-world problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, as seen in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often, a teacher will take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students to view artifacts in a museum, peek inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned annually, and earlier versions are archived online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still poor at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging also compels students to learn more about the world around them. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
With proper use, blogs can help students develop analytical skills and think critically; by actively engaging in online discussions, students can find their own place within the context of others' material and simultaneously determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and future.
Further south you'll find Niagara Falls. To the north lies the beautiful, untouched Muskoka and much more.
Things like this make Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated, and part of these areas is even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, is almost a continent unto itself.
The majority of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are linked to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west, and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether that is true or not.
It also helps to wear rings (rings that aren't too expensive-looking).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behavior they perceive as intimidating, and that it is common to be followed, have your arm grabbed, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the harbor and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish merchants who established their trading base here called it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you'll find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather products, hookahs, and other trinkets, but it's purely geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, and most of the city's streets, particularly the city center, were buried.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the latest developments regarding the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before visiting outside of Goma.
Additionally, the city serves as a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can get around Goma with boda-bodas (motor taxis). The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Timbuktu is relatively difficult to access and is therefore now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites due to sandstorms.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS exhibition "Special Wonders from the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arab appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers in size, divided into 14 diverse eco-zones where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the jewel in the crown of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entry costs apply.
It can also be handy to buy a Wild Card. These offer access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is considered the most important place by many tourists.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is already comparable to a glittering bar graph that becomes visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's population lives very densely packed together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, you can start here.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forests, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Indian and Bangladeshi territory.
The Sundarbans have now officially been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The section within Indian borders is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps—they also contain some of the last remaining powerful tracts of jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², one third of which is peat and swamp forest.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and the area is now estimated to contain 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, especially towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It's wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis allow you to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also known as 'the great province of India', originated in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
A three-century colonization period followed under the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and since then Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year here.
Check the Argentine Polo Association for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, there is only one bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. You can exchange money there.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you probably can with British and American currency. Ask the owners beforehand what payment methods they accept.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, as Falkland Islands currency is very difficult to exchange outside of them.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures often rise above +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately constant throughout the year, without discernible wet and dry periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately still wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves in the park, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elkands, bison, reindeer, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Moreover, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking scented food and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave the port. This later became known as the infamous standoff.
With the exception of a British battleship, all the ships were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle led by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent incident at a peaceful gathering in the city that escalated out of control.
There are many beaches, particularly due to Auckland's two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
Located in Central Auckland, at Waitemata's harbor, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches can sometimes be crowded and offer a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer, which isn't a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
The local drinking water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is also readily available if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Tours to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these tours to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770 from October to April. They sometimes appear outside of this period as well.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would rather swim away.
The primary habitat of saltwater crocodiles is found in river mouths north of Rockhampton, and they normally do not live in the ocean.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for travelers, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually also book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flights and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, if you have a request or would like to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, it's the case that the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to secure a campsite near the music.
And remember the following: even after the music has finished on the main stages, there may still be music playing on other parts of the festival grounds late into the night.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Pay close attention to where your hut is located when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the wind whistling through the ice makes an enormous noise if you're too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically strive to maximize the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit is sometimes hard to find.
They normally have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all experienced gamblers know it's extremely important to stay sober.
If you go high into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should be aware that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and this makes the driving experience different from driving on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period to get you stuck.
Also, visibility can be impaired by falling or blowing snow or due to condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not impede traffic there.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safaris, which for many visitors represent the highlight of their trip.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to traveling across the land to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and a standard setup allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you'll need binoculars. Otherwise, the chances of seeing them are slim.
A hiking safari (also known as a 'forest walk' or 'loop safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer, if available.
Make sure the material doesn't get too hot (this could cause the material to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
You can purify water in various ways. Some methods are effective in mitigating specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, while in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it's best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not present in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people with violence, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the ability to purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, and you often drive through desolate, rural areas, which makes this route a major challenge.
Aren't you used to driving on country roads? Keep your wits about you. You'll encounter many steep inclines, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and neighboring areas—usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it is even more important to adhere to them here than usual.
Surprisingly, you have much better coverage here than in other remote parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great, and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like those from the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see many fruit pastries. Throughout the year, the pastries contain apples, and during the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but powerful pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and hot ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the inland areas of North India and also Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
The Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But without further information, the term refers to food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese palm sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Stirrup bars support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also pose safety problems because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been implemented.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, relatively narrow sole, first and foremost.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety straps. This allows a saddle horn leather to detach from the saddle if it is pulled backward when a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports involving descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You glide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes also called "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing has existed for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates at least back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need much stiffer skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover greater distances than walking, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers have to apply for a visa and undergo passport checks multiple times when moving between different countries.
However, the Schengen Area functions almost as one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that indicates which produced articles are antiques. Some tax offices define goods that are older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition may vary per location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify handcrafted products as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi people, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. Also, the culture surrounding trade is very important to many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They engaged in fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Many Sámi people today work in modern professions. In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'Roma' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive due to the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is travel advice in place for the country you want to travel to, this may have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can consult the advice of other governments in addition to the advice of your own government. However, their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
Thus, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice only includes a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general, and extremely simplistic view compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Symptoms and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena, among others.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather conditions in their surroundings, as these may also affect their travel plans.
Everyone who wishes to visit a country considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search for 'training in hostile environments' on the internet will likely yield the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are normally dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid training, and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about wilderness survival. However, there are very few publications about war zones.
Travelers who have planned to have gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies considerably whether governments want to issue passports without a gender (X) listed, or whether they want to allow name or gender changes on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches during security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can expect not to experience this scan with intact privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow towards the beach.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is located in some deeper areas, where a rapid current to deep water can develop.
Most of the deaths occur as a result of exhaustion because they are trying to swim against the current. This could very well be impossible.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than culture shock (you have a less grand "honeymoon feeling"), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adjusting back to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your own culture in the process.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, it is not expected that patience and understanding are needed for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is among the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark, and you see them in complete silence before the show begins.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections on the pyramids, and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception. Here you will find the overflowing crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, on the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula transition into a plateau, after which they emerge again to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesotagletscher.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, encompasses the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson, at 4892 meters, is the highest mountain.
A satellite phone can be one of your options in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone isn't really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be standing outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It's becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
Especially school leavers use this to take a gap year before university without any negative consequences for their studies.
Often, enrolling in a foreign study program during a gap year can increase your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessarily needed for archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to that of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. Furthermore, it's quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
A long stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia) is included in most Baltic cruises.
This way, you can spend several full days in the historic town and stay overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you no longer need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
There's no reason to be ashamed of it: it's no different than many fears that other people have too.
If you understand how airplanes work, this can help alleviate a fear stemming from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the aircraft.
Courier companies receive generous compensation for delivering items quickly. Time often plays a very important role for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for a necessary repair.
Larger companies could deploy their own aircraft on certain routes, but it became more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
If they ship things via air freight, it can take days on some routes for them to be unloaded and clear customs.
Only as checked baggage could it be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must then be an accompanying passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a significant amount of money for this privilege (or even better, have your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business class, and about eleven times for first class.
It usually doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they therefore charge corresponding fees for this.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The Romanian language is mainly spoken here, but Russian is also very common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered under an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
New economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port besides Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
The once ancient city of Izmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center on a bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers covered in red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches – yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the small village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique eight-sided church.
On a number of graves at the church stand fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely take a look around this little village.
In the north, you'll find the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating town of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron praised the beautiful monuments there.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra, with a stopover in Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned apparitions of the Virgin Mary have taken place.
Remember that you are essentially just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked themselves to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Show all due respect, solemnity, and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti to the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Nevertheless, most signs are in Catalan, because according to the law it is the first official language.
Spanish is frequently spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in multiple languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and also Japanese.
The residents of Paris are known for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and act like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-bred). This will make exploring Paris much easier.
The tough exterior of Parisians quickly melts away when you show that you're familiar with their way of doing things.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, and this wooded area mainly consists of beech, spruce, and pine trees, encompassing a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a particularly large number of different plant communities due to the varying microclimates, soil types, and varying altitude differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse can be found, in addition to all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt below the knee and must have their shoulders covered.
Usually, if you arrive at a monastery unprepared as a woman, you'll be given a headscarf, but if you bring your own, perhaps with some bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile kindly at you.
On the other hand, men have to wear trousers at least above the knees.
Those can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Just like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used extensively.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever flavorings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, just like "Sie" meaning you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way, you make a significant distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It likely also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally doesn't pose many problems.
You have to pay most attention to the 'c' and the 'g'. The pronunciation of these letters depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also need to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means darling, while "carro" means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to the grammar will also teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you understand sentences.
It's quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar here that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't such a big problem back then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, and were more accessible than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept originated.
The first cherry blossom festivals of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, which means you should resist the urge to remove even "just one" species.
When you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you find yourself in the 'high tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which happens less often).
Some buses also go north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Check carefully if the bus you're taking actually goes to Hebron and doesn't just go to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good vacation destination.
You can, for example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise along the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also offer popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations to be found for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. During this vigil, congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, meaning that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. This means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Uniforms are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is of crucial importance. The focus is on group performance rather than rewarding individual work achievements.
Employees often need permission from their superiors before making a decision, and they are expected to follow instructions from their superiors without question.
