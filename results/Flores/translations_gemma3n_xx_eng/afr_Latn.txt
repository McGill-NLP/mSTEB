To date, there is one vaccine that reduces deaths from Ebola, but no treatments have yet shown clear suitability for treating an existing infection.
One antibody treatment, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies have shown that it offers fewer benefits than initially hoped in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
The US Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by taking a step forward with meaningful change in our organization, rather than the revocation of certificates.

This confirms not only that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are kastanjebrown (chestnut brown) on top with a pale or carroty (carrot-colored) underside.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feather did not have a well-developed spine, also known as the rachis, but it had other characteristics of feathers – plumules and barbs – and researchers inferred that the rachis was possibly a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or insulation. The researchers suggest that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the creature showed adult feathers and not chick down.
The researchers suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, it shows adult feathers and not chick down.
A car bomb that exploded this morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

The work being done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius stellar cluster.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the Milky Way's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, which causes the tides, so too does the Milky Way exert an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter surrounding a star system is found in a type of stellar halo and consists of very small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new cultivar "was very highly unsettling and distressing due to the very high mortality rate."
"Possibly, patients picked up the germ in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were health workers from the hospital."
Within one year, one infected person will infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Although, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to remain low; 6,000 out of the total 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

"Their thermal behavior is not as moderate as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with these deep shafts in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolated themselves in a booth and then placed a pre-printed paper slip indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French electoral law has codified these procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there was no stuffing at the beginning of the election and that no stuffing was added except for what was counted and by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other races, the Grand Slalom, saw her finish in tenth place in the seated women's group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11:60 minutes slower than the first-place athlete, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the ninth-place athlete, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to place in the results.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Therefore, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She remains in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish legal systems work differently, and the House viewed the publication of the photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists cross a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has overall control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be provided, at least until the charges are brought.
The document, according to the informant, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
Game rangers closely monitored the shelters in the supplementary pest control trial because the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Australian Sport shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sport shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Management and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected rangers received comprehensive safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Martelly swore in a new Provincial Elections Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the previous CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's reaction to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, with the party being accused since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry office responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency has declared that no damage has been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourist.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman since she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He studied to become a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to do research on premature births in his spare time.
Her research showed that, if hormones are administered, it will accelerate the baby's fetal lung development.
Xinhua reports that the state's investigation team recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Stunt performers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first ruler Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as I... maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 voters in the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view; they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the State Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was in doubt.
He couldn't use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery by using different hardware or software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as political chatter and nonsense.
People speculate that he will make a bid in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that promises to allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of liters of fuel annually and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to plot the aircraft with greater precision and providing pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is available, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a loss of transport have increased the possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science has reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species have adapted in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn out into a thin thread, which can be twisted or braided. It can be flattened out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The carbon juice changes color depending on how large or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The bird on your hands will react with the outer layers; it will feel strange and form a sort of cap.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, and it was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a massive rocket, over 100 feet tall, to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other vehicles.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as hares and antelopes.
Lastly, there are many small kittens (including stray pet cats) that eat considerably more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche; each cat has a special role that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related males, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions in herds behave very much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in their behavior (but not to other large cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the bear can climb (even if it's not good), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The animal is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The animal's growl isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a series of snarling, shouted words.
Small wildcats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the wildcat hunts are smaller than it is.
Scientists think that "otters" follow and find prey by smell. They sniff the ground to figure out where the animals have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move unseen. Pardel cats hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their victims.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population where they originated (such as when they migrate over a mountain range or a river, or when they migrate to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
The new environment presents different resources and other competition, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations than what they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed much; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they can no longer even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is to say, breathe out).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses and to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals couldn't live without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the predator at the top of the food chain of its time, so it feared nothing, except other Mosasaurs.
Her long jawbone had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We're not sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. His diet included shellfish, large fish, mosasaurs, and he could have even been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn't stand a chance against it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of marsupial known as a hazel dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the divinity.
People would make offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner chamber where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough like ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas it is told that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already lived there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Found at the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776". The text appeared upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that subsequently broke out liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was under French control by the "Vichy" regime. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and French forces liberated the south of France and pushed them towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people who cooperate and live and work as a community.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which comes from "civil," meaning citizen, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or something like a city, and it also defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture is one that transmits knowledge across many generations, leaves a lasting cultural footprint, and ensures equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures regularly disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with the Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national enforcer or court, they relied on the state authorities, which often did not want to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were regularly absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as an "archipelago" due to the cluster of islands it comprises.
Taiwan has long been known since the 15th century when European explorers passed by and took the island's name as Ilha Formose, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation in indigenous grain production practices by employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644 – 1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been eroded, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or closely estimated to this aspect ratio.
The often-misused and frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has bound European states together despite language and cultural differences.
The all-pervading power of it affected everyone; from the king to the community members.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church exist specifically for this purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church in Rome, and this concentration of power and money, has led many to question this starting point.
Shortly after the outbreak of unrest, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective; it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law through several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would be dangerous even for neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that was in control was a separate dynasty.
There was also between each dynasty an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods of the Three Kingdoms period took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was severe warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants who were the most ambitious and successful and were allowed to succeed.
This applies to the military, as the military range is now based on caliber, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Moehammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of Light ("Noor") for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world and rests on one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In truth, it's not easy to find, even if one knew it existed. When a person is in a cave, it's a complete isolation.
Nothing but the beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the death of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward curve" mark looks like a V, and the "downward curve" mark looks like a little hook or a square without its bottom side.
"On" means you start at the point and pull the bow, and "off" means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow back.
An open arch usually produces a softer sound, while a closed arch is stronger and more self-sufficient.
Feel free to write your own markings, but remember that the printed bar lines are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a wagon, they traveled back to Paris while they were surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the protestors waved the head of a royal person who was killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were largely paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to resolve a large portion of the expenses and the interest on bonds was driven through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Naturally, the super profits gained from the extended exploitation of the Filipino people would make up the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple Servants, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological drive or the technological necessity in a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic accompanied by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces "effects" on society that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motorcar inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose that were connected to that environment, and these things, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The fame of it being an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The design was strongly influenced at the beginning by Byzantine culture in the East.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Near the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades, which led people to start using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Permaculture is a simple, often organic system that combines locally adapted seeds with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers are involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect due to community standards are brought together by subcultures and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characterized by the age, ethnic origin, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a characteristic and symbolic use of styles, encompassing fashion, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, adverse circumstances, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are labeled as "runaways" or wild. Some wild children have been caged (usually by their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment can be attributed to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have possibly experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that some were raised by animals; some remained in the wild on their own.
When a child is wholly raised by non-human animals, it displays behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular animal raising it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, traditional work goes a step further.
Staircase work is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are starting to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
Mentors can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a form of mentor, as is the small clip-on figure in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Tutors are in the software and are intended to challenge, accelerate, and clarify procedures for students who would find it difficult to handle the process on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Community care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were suspended from their home where they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and reward approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) investigated user responses to websites, they identified "personal involvement" and "continued relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is mentioned that one can tell when a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his documentary "The President's Speech," indicated that people who were unable to understand the speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants that are available there.
Furthermore, failure to do so had serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant resources would have been the proteins, which occur in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in a way similar to that of some chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Sleep disruption is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relative quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you catch yourself setting the clock while you're asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to get up so you can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates with the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can find relief. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and clashes of systems, processes, and culture that led to the countries breaking apart.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies had become current enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was the last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by standing troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge line.
However this might have been the case, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created chaos after they had entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Agreement, and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the fleets was traditionally to ensure that your country retained the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic expedition of WWII. The Americans attempted to get troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would very likely have been able to conquer Britain, as it could have conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats have been commonly kept in herds that roamed over the hills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of care are still used today.
Waspore was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although covered wagons usually consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses they pulled to do so at greater speeds and with heavier loads than it would take to do it on the by-and-large rougher roads of today.
Crossbeams were installed quite early to hold the tracks in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be more effective if there was an iron strip on top.
It had become common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transportation was walking; people started walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright normally.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more kindly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
That's like symptomatic treatment in many cases. How else can it be, if we don't just look for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and neutralize them?
It is clear enough that the world has changed a great deal as a result of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
Following adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at the Independence Hall site on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are known as the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers currently in use are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers – or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenthood so that another couple may adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
Although it is not the only thing, experimentation – and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations – also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology, and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, are recorded in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells that are affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities on the property include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visit parks and studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn from and photograph orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small village in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area from where they have just departed.
In this dynamic commuting vehicle, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars in one way or another.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the stable conditions of the biosphere that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers operate within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows exhibit a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of roller screening facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back onto their bodies.
This offers them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are stick insects and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The people of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt were awestruck by their predecessors' monuments, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by many people who work in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they can transform into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles, called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in that point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it was first released.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and use have declined as newer writing methods have been adopted.
People now write messages on computer screens and don't need to go to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fissile bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The splitting of a nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70km thick on the near side and 100km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to want what they do, and the things in their environment that lead them to do certain things or not do things.
Two popular motivational theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior may emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
The leader is, after all, responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members frequently function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They regularly have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams meet across different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized throughout the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the organization's process works together to overcome the obstacle and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the client's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study, before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of work performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect cognitive function and, in some cases, alter mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Al has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
Such things have become specialized disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now regularly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military units, and is also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a good way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Web journals can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their web journal experiences with sloppy language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, web journal writers strive for improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more skilled about the world around them." The necessity to cater to the interests of the masses inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions within the context of others' writings, as well as develop their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and houses a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as being more truly Canadian than what outsiders typically consider Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it gained a strong foothold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India via the Cape.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, have their arms grabbed, etc.
Be firm when you dismiss men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (Cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shopping malls in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of surplus items, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be investigated to continuously understand the state of fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished town, although its reputation as a tourist attraction is appealing, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the most prominent talking points during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab flair than an Afrikaans one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and follows the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and access fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card" which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name, and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared with a dazzling column chart, accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers claimed for themselves, and so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world and extends 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The woodlands are not merely halophyte swamps – they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², approximately one-third of which is covered in water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and departing between 6:30 and 7:30 am for Jakar/Bumthang.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared rental cars are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long, with two tracks 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group that inhabited the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced swidden agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," came into being as a result of skirmishes between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds will be widely accepted throughout the islands, and within the territory, Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards will most likely not be accepted, although British and United States currencies will be; ask the owners in advance to determine what the accepted payment methods will be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
The winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from baboons, wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals.
No matter how harmless they may seem, buffaloes, bushbuck, American bushbuck, baboons, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, thousands of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Please be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking or carrying fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious fleet stand-off in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village caused the death of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches over two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Langbaai in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most of them have shady spots provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes family beaches are packed with a good selection of shops at the edge of the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be transported better.
The tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an espresso, cappuccino is topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many dives are undertaken to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries on the coral reef due to any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, take advice from authorities, obey all notifications, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Discussing in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, even if you find it impossible to arrange other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include airport transfers, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the discussions for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or inquiries must go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to come in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages might come to an end, there might be areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the North Baltic Sea region in winter, make sure of the hut's location, as it causes a lot of noise, for those most affected, to go through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in the town. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the amount of money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To stay true to their core values and keep guests in a good mood, they typically offered special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs your judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving through mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
Traction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you can't drive as if you're on a bare asphalt road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-blown snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari, which is commonly used, refers to an overland trip to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannas.
Wild animals, such as elephants and camels, tend to approach carts and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or trek/walk) consists of a walk lasting a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies differ, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies no longer extend to June 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place, from late March.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes makes them dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is unavailable, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the material doesn't get too hot, (otherwise it can shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are various ways to purify water; some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases that are unfamiliar in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with violence, usually do not qualify as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, where it frequently travels through abandoned inland terrain.

Stirrups are for the support of the rider's feet which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but can pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a horse throws its rider and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. Several safety measures can be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some riding arenas, especially English arenas, have safety rails that allow a saddle strap to detach from the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.

Ski tours: This activity can also be called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This is related to that, but does not include alpine skiing tours or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will cover somewhat greater distances than walking – but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-maintained trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant having to go through visa applications and passport control points multiple times.
The Schengen Area, nevertheless, works somewhat like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
By having a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply to each of the Schengen member states individually, thus saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what qualifies a manufactured item as an antique or not. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.

Finland is a good boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the island group and lakes, you don't necessarily need a sailboat.
Although the coastal areas' archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any hunt, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boat trips are a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is in accordance with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in Holland the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises usually include extended vacation stays.

If they ship this stuff by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance can take days on some routes.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines' regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or even better – your company gets to do it for you).
Therefore, it is not cheap, however: as a rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal rate for economy and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of arriving at a destination quickly and in comfort, and their bill reflects this.
