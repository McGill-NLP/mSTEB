This confirms not only that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but also shows details that fossils usually don't have the opportunity to reveal, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather functions – barbules and a vane – researchers assumed that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, like the other relevant features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample actually shows adult plumage and not down feathers.
The researchers suggested that, even though this was part of a dinosaur's tail, the sample showed the plumage of an adult and not chick down.

Public irritation led to the current effort to create a website policy regarding sexually explicit content. The website hosts millions of openly licensed media files.
The work that was carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects gravity on Earth, and thus causes tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll contracted tuberculosis (XDR-TB) which was particularly resistant to medication in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the bacteria at the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers.

Infrared images show the temperature variations between night and day, suggesting that there are likely caves there.
They are colder than the surface that surrounds it during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which are often maintained by a fairly constant temperature, but is, on the other hand, consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters go into a booth alone, place a pre-printed card on paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French electoral law has a rather strict codification of court proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except for those that have been carefully counted and from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers according to specific procedures and under strict supervision.

Her first discipline was Slalom, but she did not finish the race. 36 out of 116 competitors did not finish the slalom race.
In her second race, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gøngyi Dani from Hungary in ninth place.
In the women's seated group, there were four skiers who failed to finish the race, and 45 of the total 117 competitors in the giant slalom failed to advance.
Madhya Pradesh police retrieved the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Acting Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused has been named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The suspect appeared in court with covered faces, said Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
Emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh's court with the murder of his son.
She is in custody and awaiting indictment and trial, but any potential eyewitnesses may have been influenced since her image has been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in Great Britain, but Scottish law works differently, so courts consider whether publishing images could potentially harm the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be in a precarious position if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution authorities, that no further comments will be made before the indictment.
According to the leak, the document is supposed to refer to the border disputes, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics that were raised.
Israel continues to demand a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to allow this force to remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control were closely monitored by forest rangers, which led to the court case being monitored and its efficiency evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new election council (CEP) of 9 members yesterday.
It's actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the previous dismissal of the CEP (Haiti's electoral commission) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to the lack of held elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' crisis management office said that no injuries were reported in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication that a tsunami would occur.
A Filipino man with a prior background in law enforcement held tourists in Hong Kong captive by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
More hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, photographers took the seat of an old woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained to become an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins started investigating premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would increase the rate of development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was just as strange as me... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent in the poll share this viewpoint and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim both 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the complaints, people have started to doubt his form.
He hasn't been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are prohibited by the drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, in addition to organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially with regard to Earth.
Cuomo (53) began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and foolishness."
There is speculation about whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and save a lot of fuel annually while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, in contrast to older ground-based technology, which allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be put in place, above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The possibility of being forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's support staff was raised due to fear of a lack of transportation.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that new species had evolved in just two generations, although many had believed that this process would take much longer due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, the House Finch, and the cactus finch immigrant, the Large Cactus Finch.
Gold can come in all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into incredibly small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhere firmly to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was occasionally used as decoration in the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color completely depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is marked by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical that was tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels strange and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In olden days, there were also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
Whenever you call someone who is several thousand kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down again, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A gigantic rocket over 100 British feet long is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in wonderful ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transport that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many modes of transport such as the train, car, and more.
Underneath them, there are several medium-sized cat-like animals that eat medium-sized prey such as hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are several small domestic cats (including stray pet cats) that eat the far more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success is the niche concept. A special job each cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, and they live together in larger groups called prides.
The alliances consist of 1-3 adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much in the same way as a wolf or dog pack, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other large cats). They are also deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of growling sounds.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings before attacking.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from, for example by moving over a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island from which they cannot easily return, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different features or adjustments than they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population hasn't changed; they still need the same adjustments as before.
As the new people gradually adapt to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
After a couple of thousand years, or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so just breathe out well).
Plants make their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals wouldn't survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the ultimate predator in its time, unafraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper jaw; nothing that crossed its path came away alive.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had an incorrect tongue. The diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked anything that came into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like, for example, a T. rex, wouldn't stand a chance against it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including pork, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food items that came to Europe from the USA or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god, and these were seen as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests attempted to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary built for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family mostly lived outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the garden; stores were only open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the rural areas around Canaan, which made timber extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they discovered Greenland while traveling westward and named it Greenland.
But Inuit tribes already lived there at that time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian."
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite something being written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So the note was likely added as a label.
The invasion and the subsequent battles on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals. These were French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The invasion on August 15, 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, the Americans and free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large population who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, linked to Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and this thus defines, in a way, the size of society.
District states are precursors to nations. A civilization requires passing knowledge on through generations, a linguistic footprint, and fair transmission that endures.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national leader or judicial system, it was dependent on the state authorities, who were usually unwilling to cooperate in enforcing its actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax law and the tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government lightly, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national teams are the second-best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan consists of, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 1400s when passing European sailors gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began implementing a shift towards indigenous crop production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice paddies and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally constructed.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was completed restored in 1976, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited the aspect ratio of the camera itself.
It can be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio to this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar to, or approximately similar to, this aspect's ratio.
The rules of thirds are often misused and ridiculed, but they are a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also providing a framework for order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had linked European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is why the church has funds.
The Church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified through numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom bombed international waters to prevent ships from entering large parts of the sea, creating danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare, as there had been limited reaction to this tactic.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing all the fear and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known in these periods were the Three Kingdoms that took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many kings fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while fighting to hold power in the grand palace by the Xiadian.
There are a number of social and political effects resulting from the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is governed by its citizens instead of just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it remained open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the defense, because instead of military ranks based on class, they now based them on caliber.
The French Revolution was motivation for other oppressed people in the working class in other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the mortal life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light), where he went to contemplate.
The cave itself, preserved over the years, provides a very vivid portrayal of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On a mountain peak north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. The moment you're inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There's nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, encompasses many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol resembles a V, and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the nock and pull the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more decisive.
You can certainly use a pencil and make your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be taken into account.
The terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette together with their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were on October 6, 1789, forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The King and Queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and yelled threats against them.
The ethnic group forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows completely open.
A member of the band at one point swung a head towards a royal guard, killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The Filipino people had to pay for the cost of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to levy taxes to the American colonial regime to cover large parts of the costs, and the interest on the bonds was conducted in the name of the Philippine authorities via the bank houses in Wall Street.
The super-profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the order's establishment.
The period in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire largely did not interfere with the societal culture and traditions during most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse, inclusive ruling elites, which led to more systematic, centralized, and uniform regulations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions: that the development of technology itself follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that road development comes about because of the car.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable if it is only used by a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership creates more road accidents, which has led to the development of new methods in the healthcare sector for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a greater element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals, and that over time geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these, when they harmonized with their position in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in our time, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It has been known to be a center of luxury from approximately 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The situation was not the same in the 12th century primarily due to the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak from the 10th to the 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest changes that occurred at the time, and as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is farming for the production of enough food to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Permaculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses locally sourced seeds combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize relatively easy yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be special due to their members' age, ethnicity, class, area, and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate how important socialization is is to take as a starting point the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse, were not sufficiently socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wildlings". Some wild children have been held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is possible that children who are feral may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When a feral child is completely raised by animals, it develops behavior (within physical limitations) that is almost identical to that of the raising animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as when using new software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. A teacher can also, in other words, be a form of scaffolding, as can the little clip-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support features have been integrated into the software and are intended to ask questions, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a number of different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No children should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it happens.
We perceive that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system shall ensure safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It's a combination of elements involving both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to extra dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal engagement" and "lasting relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
Using video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it has been claimed that one can find out if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his article, "The President's Tale," that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity correctly.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new gene variation, and selection removes it from the range of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans' to obtain sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources on the savanna.
Furthermore, there are significant consequences to not doing so: economic recession, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most readily available plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are in contrast not only easily digestible, but they also provide proteins in high quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
We shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" with a method quite similar to the one chimpanzees on the savanna use today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of conscious arousal during normal sleep periods, followed by falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a fairly quiet alarm clock that gently brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you experience turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve having drunk plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, and this leads to the need to get up to urinate.
The more inner peace a person has, the less tension there is in their body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only thing standing in the way of gaining such insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded to include the Mahayana school's path of loving-kindness and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and unconditional love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) can be awakened with Kundalini yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation revolves around deity yoga. The energy channels are cleansed by visualizing various deities. This will activate the chakras and enlighten consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes between systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places in Africa to Asia.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the last chance was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian border.
These plans were nevertheless rendered obsolete practically overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland, forming the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish peace treaty, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to provide aid to Great Britain.
The German navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe.
Probably, goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It started with old cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hillsides or other places for grazing, usually tended by goat herders who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Road lanes in England were created as early as the 1500s.
Even though the roads only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull to achieve greater speeds and haul more cargo than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
To keep the rails in place, a cross rail was introduced quite early. However, little by little it was realized that the rails were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron created more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rims were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transport. Humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) evolved.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and bidirectional specialization has been discovered in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago.
We can start by adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to, to a certain extent, reduce future suffering.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed a great deal due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and difficulties have become more complicated because of overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap after its introduction to Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight and are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
The one arrived to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day – they are called birds.
Some people don't consider those with feathers and the ability to fly to be true dinosaurs.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of a dinosaur.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Essentially, almost all PCs used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be finding open medicine containers or poisonous household items at the scene.
For first aid instructions specific to the poison in question, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This term originates from an ancient connection with the middle, insects highly adapted to attack humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or the homes of their hosts.
As far as we know, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women have twice the chance of getting multiple sclerosis (MS) than men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that it's not best for them, or the child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
Experimentation is not solely about that, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by posing questions. Observations also contribute to guiding scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West grew further removed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms seen in physiology and behavior are usually entirely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been detected in virtually all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not only as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals claiming that DNA could be the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted 2 experiments to label either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are bacterial or eukaryotic cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and examining details about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village the others are driving out of.
In this dynamic mode of transport, everyone is in one way or another connected to, and a supporter of, a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has pushed the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so much dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, it's complicated to study traffic flow, since it's impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers fortunately tend to behave with a reasonable degree of consistency, which helps keep traffic flow relatively consistent and allows for mathematical calculation with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in connection with the planning, design, and operation of driving track facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and find mates.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
Due to this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and houseflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the world's largest and second-longest river. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, being up to ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rainforests on Earth and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon River, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Even though pyramids were still being built in stone until the ancient Egyptian empire ended, they never surpassed the size and technical execution of the pyramids at Giza.
Egyptians from the New Kingdom in ancient times marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by the Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used daily by government employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every resident of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can all be found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mix of one or more of the earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also thought that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mix of 2 or more metals. Remember that there is a diversity of elements in the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that some trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been considered to have lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on PC screens, and must never get close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that assembling a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons requires energy.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Shattering the core anew and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less spontaneously.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the sides and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under Maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible there's more magma on the side facing us because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and approach adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain individuals that makes them desire what they want, and which aspects of their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two behavioral patterns emerge when leaders start leading their former colleagues. One part of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the gang."
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change absolutely everything the group has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular club members, as their teams may meet according to many different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
An "invisible team" that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management group that each of the members reports to. The invisible group sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal is to put organizational learning concepts into practice, and that is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can arise.
The process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can therefore lead to a new, innovative process that can help meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to assist organizations in improving performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical documentation for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. It narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Brain structures and processes that we have never been able to observe before are now possible to investigate thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our brain.
Even though artificial intelligence (AI) gives a strong feeling of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control and planning of the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines focused on developing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, and are built into many home PCs and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of all classrooms. Teachers usually love to take students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology enables the possibility of a solution with virtual excursions. Students can observe museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire great art while sitting with their class.
A great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes is also to share the excursion virtually.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital every year; the website is restructurated each year, but old versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Bloggers can also contribute to improving students' writing. Even though students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
The blogger started to improve their writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Blogging also "forces students to become more up-to-date on the world around them." The need to provide what the audience wants inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students think more analytically and critically; by reacting actively to online materials, students can define their positions in relation to others, as well as sketch out their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and in the north, in Muskoka and further out, you find untouched nature in all its beauty.
All of this and more is what outsiders consider authentic Canadian, as Ontario shows.
Large areas northward are sparsely populated, and in some places, they are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population figures that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed or have someone grab your arm, etc.
Be firm about saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century before the Common Era and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to leave it abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built up the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca due to Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the dullest shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoodies, and a whole spectrum of trinkets, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano; the eruption resulted in most of the city's streets, especially the city center, being buried.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched in advance to understand the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable hiking trips to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Even though Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat from desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park is 19,500 km² in size and can be divided into 14 different ecoregions, which support diverse wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the most beautiful national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which provides access to either a selection of parks or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline in Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph, clearly displayed thanks to the waterway that is Victoria Harbor.
If you want the finest view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to Kowloon's waterfront, which lies opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest mangrove forest in the world is the Sundarbans, located 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps – here you can find some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the gigantic plains.
Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km² with approximately one-third of the area covered by water and swamp.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, despite most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, traveling between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and sturdy serve most of the districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapok River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers soar 83 meters, it is 378 meters tall, and it has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group; they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," became a country as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The colonization period, which lasted for 3 centuries, was started by the Spanish.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its own local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December, at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falklands, with a value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, which is located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards, as well as US dollars, are also often accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what payment method is approved.
It's difficult to exchange Falklands money outside the islands, so be sure to exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in the summer months, temperatures are often above +30°C.
The cold can be misleading in the winter since the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
It's not really a distinct "rainy" or "dry" season – the amount of rainfall is similar throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but still, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack regardless of how peaceful they may appear.
Annually, dozens of visitors get injured because they haven't kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly meals and keep a clean campsite.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the notorious site of the sea protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting led to the murder of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's two harbors, there are several beaches. The most popular ones are in 3 locations.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most important local beer is "Nummer en," which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that should be tasted, but wine from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easily available.
For people from Australia, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is called "espresso," cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
Throughout the year, there are many trips to the rapids, and injuries rarely occur due to any of these things.
Nevertheless, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and carefully follow safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be observed outside of this period.
There are sharks, but it's unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, as they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book accommodation in other areas, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies most often sell package deals including breakfast, transfer to and from the airport, or even combination packages with flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your agreement (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of security guards decide to camp on site, and most of them consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night even after the music on the main stage has finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are planning to cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the location of your cabin, as driving through the ice creates extremely loud noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms and conditions).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment for guests, so that they will be in a good mood and want to stay at the place.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But alcohol impairs judgment; all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or cold.
Friction is low, so on icy and snowy roads you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to slip and fall.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest form of tourism attracting tourists to Africa and is the main attraction for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips to countries to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which allows for good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "balance walk") involves going on a hike, for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be from August 24, 2021 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. The city held the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you're in for a rough time.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, cancellation policies will not be extended to July 2020, as the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
It can help to iron damp clothes to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it's not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing perfectly pressed socks, you can try using a hairdryer instead, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are various ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's sufficient to boil the water for a minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're unsure, you can always buy bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter infectious animal diseases that they are not familiar with from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Actual infectious diseases, or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing people with their power, are usually not qualified as plague.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often goes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a cool head: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
Speed limits that have been posted are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35–40 American miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and it is even more important to respect them than usual.
Surprisingly, the mobile reception is much better here than along many other places along the route, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty. In Bavaria, they are rich and varied, and can be compared to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked inside year-round, and cherries and plums make their entrance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts that grow on trees. Many of the popular cakes taste extra good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid in it, a curry dish can be either dry or moist.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is regularly used in curries, whereas coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian dishes are a broad term, covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the nation.
If it is used without further specification, the term usually means food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now much is available throughout the archipelago; Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes with a dominant flavor of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down on each side of the saddle and provide support for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less secure due to the possibility of the rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged after the horse if it runs away. Many precautions can be taken to minimize this danger.
Most riders first use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that cause the leather of the stirrup to fall down from the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America's Yosemite, with many large granite walls and boulders.
The summit climb offers stunning views from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in the endless seas of mountain walls.
Downhill sports, encompassing both skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered areas on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Ski vacations are a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bombers," who plan entire holidays around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century. In 1861, the first recreational-based ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also has other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include alpine skiing or alpine climbing; the latter is done in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you were walking – but it is very rare that you will achieve high speeds without a heavy backpack on the trail.
Europe is a rather small continent, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several nations would mean several visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, functions much like one country when it comes to this.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not need to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member state if you have a Schengen visa, and you therefore save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what kinds of manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities consider objects older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, including the fact that the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques despite being newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people and also important for the trading culture for many with other professions.
Even though traditionally not all Sámi people have been involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, they made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, while reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
In our time, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even though the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Romanian people.
If travel advisories are issued for the country you plan to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with other authorities besides your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example could be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The presentations offered are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very severe weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social consequences, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types. Weather types can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, torrential rain, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered war zones should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for "hostile environment training" will likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involves role-playing, some first aid, and occasionally weapon training.
It's common to find books and magazines about wilderness survival, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the time after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive.
Preoperative trans people should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the recurring current of waves that break on the beach, a reef, or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, creating a rapid current and allowing deep water to form there.
Most of the deaths occur due to exhaustion during attempts to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
As soon as you get out of the current, it's no more problematic than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be pulled in again, or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
A reverse culture shock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the excitement phase isn't present in the same way as with moving away), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits from your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, since they know that the traveler has to adapt to a completely new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things in the area for children is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night, and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The description of the sound and light is just like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is used both as a background element and as a narrator in a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The Shetland Islands (South Shetland Islands) that were discovered in 1819 are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is Kong George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reappear and form the 360 km long mountain range that are the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson's summit has an altitude of 4892 meters and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part or Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with no mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone can generally not replace a mobile phone, as you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, recreational boats, and also on expeditions that require remote sensing and communication.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telecommunications provider.
Getting instruction while traveling is an increasingly common option for those planning to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among graduating students ("russen") so they can take a gap year before university without weakening their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Normally, there will be a school fee that needs to be registered in this type of educational program.
Finland is a great destination for those who love boats. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
A yacht is not necessary in the archipelagoes and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Even though this is the same for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it's otherwise quite unique (like in the Netherlands, where the number is up to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic city and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only arrive by using boat excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different than other things that many people fear or dislike.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help some people overcome a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Shipping companies get a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but it was problematic for smaller companies.
If they shipped things by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes to get through customs and the cargo handling process.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to fork over a thick stack of money for the privilege (or even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this isn't reasonable: As a rough guideline, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the usual economy price for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts for business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multiethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but it has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transport hub.
Smyrna was formerly just an old city, but is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are designed with traditional red pitched roofs, the square from the 18th century along with old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European Mediterranean region than traditional Turkey.
You can see the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusually octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling around the fascinating village.
North and not too far away lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. It became known to foreigners after Lord Byron gave it glowing praise.
Scotturb bus number 403 regularly travels to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the massive crypt Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place with Marian art that is popular worldwide.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, in addition to a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this space with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or scratching graffiti onto structures.
Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer Catalan, and most have an understanding of the language, but virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only indicated in Catalan because it is enshrined in law as the first official language.
Spanish is also used on public transport and in other facilities, nonetheless.
Common messages at the Metro station are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide selection of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The stereotype of Parisians is that they are egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get far in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It will make it considerably easier to get around.
The Parisians' quick facade quickly disappears if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very large number of animal and bird species.
There, one rarely finds fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owls, lynx, wildcat, and grouse, in association with several common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has light colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear trousers that go over the knees.
This could also be borrowed from the storage room at the entrance, but the clothes may not be washed after each use, so they might be less comfortable to wear. One size fits all!
Mallorcan dishes, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, are based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and use olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked dinner, at least in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: slices of bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns that appear with the word "Sie" for you always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence. **Note:** "Sie" is a German pronoun. The Norwegian sentence is referring to a grammatical rule related to the pronoun "han/hun/den/det" (he/she/it) being used in conjunction with other words. The translation attempts to capture the *meaning* of the Norwegian sentence, even though the specific German pronoun isn't directly applicable in English grammar. I've adjusted the phrasing slightly to make the English clearer and more natural. A more literal translation wouldn't make sense.
This is an important method for being able to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
That undoubtedly makes reading easier, even though the writing is a bit difficult, because one then has to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be aware of are c and g, since their pronunciation differs depending on the following vowel.
In addition, you should pay attention to the difference in pronunciation between 'r' and 'rr': 'caro' means darling, while 'carro' means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and quite straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find that Portuguese is close enough that they don't need to study it separately.
Former observatories are usually a bit outdated in our time and are often used for museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem during their heyday as it is today, they typically reside in cities or near educational institutions that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern astronomical telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms shown have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China, where the blossoming plum blossom was the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties were arranged by the emperor in Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden and pick any "samples," you will also be thrown out without question.
Singapore is generally a place with high security, it's a very easy place to find your way around, and you can get most things there after you arrive.
However, if you are located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to consider both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which doesn't happen as often).
There are also a couple of buses that go north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives, are buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, which is nearby.
The inland waterways can be a fun theme to base a trip on.
For example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions we have during the holiday season have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake throughout Easter night at an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
It could certainly have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are, of course, also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold Easter service on a Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the services often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The mammals couldn't make the journey due to the long distance to the continent, and thus the large land tortoise became the first herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands since humans arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, a time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
Since the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Business attire is standard workwear, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Collaboration is important in the workplace, with an emphasis on teamwork rather than rewarding individual achievements.
Employees often need their superiors' approval for any decisions they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
