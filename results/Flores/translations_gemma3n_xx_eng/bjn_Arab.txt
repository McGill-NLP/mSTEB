This is a very interesting and difficult translation! The sentence appears to be a mix of Banjar script and Arabic script, and the words are not entirely standard. It seems to be referencing a conference or event and a possible registration number. Here's a translation attempting to capture the likely meaning, with some notes on the uncertainty: "This is my banner, held in Yogyakarta. The registration number is 0000." **Explanation of choices and uncertainties:** * **"ايڽامانيس بانر وان ليهاي باڽڽي جووا"**: This is the trickiest part. * "ايڽامانيس" (inyamanis) – Likely "This is my..." * "بانر" (banner) – The word "banner" is transliterated directly. * "وان ليهاي" (wan lihai) – This is unclear. "Wan" could be a prefix or part of a name. "Lihai" might relate to skill or talent, but its usage here is uncertain. I translated it as "held in" to try and create a somewhat logical flow. * "بڽڽي جووا" (bڽڽi Jawa) – This likely refers to Yogyakarta, a city in Indonesia. "Jawa" is the island name. "Bڽڽi" is a less common spelling but seems to indicate "in" or "at" in this context. * **"اوجرڽ بادساراكن رقمن كونفرينسي ڤيرس"**: * "اوجرڽ" (ujarnya) – This translates to "His/Her/Its speech/saying/mention." It refers to the speaker or source of the information. * "بادساراكن" (badasarakan) – "Based on" or "referring to." * "رقمن كونفرينسي" (raqam konferensi) – "Conference number" or "registration number." * "ڤيرس" (vers) – Likely a shortened form of "version" or possibly a conference name/acronym. In this context, it's taken as part of the registration number, as it's very short. **Important Note:** Without more context, this translation is an educated guess. The nuances of the language are unclear, and the meaning might be slightly different in a specific context. There could also be errors in the transliteration of the words.

"Sadin" implies sadness or sorrow, and "menembehan" is a complicated word suggesting an underlying feeling. * **دلم مأرتيکن کبيسأن منوسيا (dalam martikan kebesaran manusia):** "In the greatness/worth of humanity."
