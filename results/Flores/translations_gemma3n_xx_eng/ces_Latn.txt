This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as information about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, which is a central shaft, but possess other features – barbs and hooks – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests it wasn't used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Scientists believe that even though this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not juvenile ones.
Scientists presume that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it represents a feather sample from an adult animal and not downy feathers of a juvenile.
A bomb in a vehicle that exploded near a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They found out that the Sun functions on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in a system is apparently determined solely by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of a star is determined, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of its magnetic rotation.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team investigated a phenomenon that could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on Earth and causes the tides of the sea, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant is "highly concerning, even alarming, due to its high virulence."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital staff.
Over the course of one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at one point in time in South Africa.

The police said the body looked like it had been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease appeared at the end of July this season.
This disease is transmitted to pigs and spreads to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying wild boar hunters in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
The government also promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare healthcare agencies for next year.
Vaccination plans intended for delivery to the historically most vulnerable regions for this year have been postponed due to a lack of resources and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

Infrared photos show that the temperature differences between day and night suggest this is likely a cave.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night, they are warmer.
"Their temperature fluctuations are not as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed slip of paper into a ballot box, indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes were present in them before the start of the voting and that no other envelopes were added than those inserted by the counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives who will then witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four female skiers in a women's group who were skiing sitting down did not finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Police Director D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped a woman from Switzerland, and we have seized a mobile phone and a laptop belonging to the victim from those arrested."
The accusations are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in pre-trial detention awaiting charges and trial, but witness testimony may be discredited because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts viewed the publication of the photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly treading on thin ice if they publish photographs etc. of suspected individuals."
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the criminal proceedings, has informed journalists that no further information will be provided until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will concern border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Apparently, further included topics encompass the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were under strict supervision of rangers during the supplementary pest protection study, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPSW and NSW Inc. (Australian Association of Sport shooters), qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for heritage preservation at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first firing received comprehensive safety training and conditioning.
Martelly yesterday swore in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Committee (CEP).
It's Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous government as part of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The Commission represented the reaction to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize the elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to facilities.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious at all."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Office for Managing Extraordinary Situations of the Northern Mariana Islands announced that no damages had been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami here.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at this time at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were quickly released, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the older woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Liggins was working in the hospital, in his free time he began to deal with premature births.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
The Sin-chua agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" containing flight data on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night when there were two moons in the sky. Unique, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated, "Luna was crazy like me... maybe even crazier... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's somewhere where it's better."
A public opinion poll conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections in 2010 showed that the number of people who disagree with Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
The Prime Minister of the interim government, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding extreme views within the survey, 29 percent of respondents are convinced that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold Olympic medalist was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his objections, his eligibility was questioned.
He couldn't get the medicine he needed to overcome the pain because medication is banned in Hrahy.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
The discovery, made using various hardware and software, was confirmed by several people at the beginning of February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, particularly how Earth formed from cometary impacts that occurred long ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed these rumors as "political chatter and recklessness."
There are speculations that they will attempt a presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and thus save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
Compared to technology based on ground-based radar, satellite technology allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
No extraordinary transport will be introduced, an elevated rail line will not be built at Wembley, and no parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
Concerns about a lack of transport options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that new species have evolved within just two generations, despite the expectation that this process would take much longer, considering the interbreeding between endemic finches, Darwin's finches, and cactus finches and ground finches.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It's possible to roll it into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be split or pressed into flakes.
It can be processed into considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice from cabbage changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (represented by the letter H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then form a ball from them with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a peculiar sensation and forming a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of wastewater systems have been found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which men and women visited together.
When calling someone thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite for the conversation.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal almost instantly back down to Earth.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the field of view.
A large rocket, measuring over 100 feet, is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant thing it caused was the substantial simplification and acceleration of transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cat-like predators, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats), whose main part of their diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in a system of ecological niches, meaning that each cat has its own tasks that prevent it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to three related adult males together with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related and represent a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's roar from the depths of its being, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is himself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals for food (prey) by scent, recognizing their paths by sniffing the ground.
At night, they see very well thanks to their night vision and are able to move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, when they cross a mountain range or river, or migrate to a new island from which it is difficult to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has various resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than it was in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is of plant origin. Animals couldn't survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with more than 70 teeth as sharp as razors and an extra set embedded in the upper jaw, meaning that nothing that crossed its path had a chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a varied diet. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have even been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their dishes wouldn't be unfamiliar to us, the Romans had their share of peculiar or unusual banquet compositions, including game, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a woodchuck.
Another difference was that women and the poor ate their meals sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to host banquets together and recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman diets could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They, for example, didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Northern sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Vinland.
Despite his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were part of "Scandinavia," there were many differences among the inhabitants, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie *Pirates of the Caribbean*, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That, however, is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are located. The text is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known for certain, it is clear that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ x 24½ inches) was shortly after its creation rolled into a scroll and stored away.
Therefore, it is likely that the entry was added simply as an afterthought.
The landing in Normandy and the subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
He was ruled by the French "Vichy". These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated instead of fighting with the invading forces.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a certain culture, shared by a significant and extensive group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, i.e., together they form a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civilian," and it relates to the Latin "civis," which means "citizen," and also "civitas," which means city or city-state, and in a way, it defines the size of a society.
The predecessors of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and a moderate spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government, where the Congress was its only component, falling under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities to enforce laws, which often failed to cooperate.
It also had no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states and could only be supplemented afterwards. The states took the central government lightly, to such an extent that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Among the popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are very popular in northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of these is Honshu, so Japan is actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Considering the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production practices by employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, units of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main sectors: Inti Watana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the most frequent film size at the peak of the era of analog photography.
They are still made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has been adopted by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
Although it's somewhat confusing, the 35mm format actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) have aspect ratios that are equal to or closely approximate this ratio.
The frequently misused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in an image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, became the object of detailed scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church are for this very purpose.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it disrupted vital military and civilian supply lines, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the past two centuries.
Britain was patrolling international waters to prevent ships from reaching vast areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic met with only a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the twenties, attitudes of pacifism and isolation were prevalent among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses to the horrors and cruelty of World War I, the nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each era of China or each ruling dynasty was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war unfolded among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to gain the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, thus enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army, as instead of military ranks based on social class, abilities now matter.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start revolutions in their own countries.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters beyond the sphere of worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and meditated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a significant period, offers a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Due to its location on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find her at all, even if you knew she existed. She is in complete isolation inside the cave.
You can see nothing but a wonderfully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see and hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The brand "bow upwards" looks like the letter V and "bow downwards" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and press down, down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Movement upwards usually produces a softer sound, while movement downwards is louder and more piercing.
You can write your own markings on the letter with a pen, however, keep in mind that printed markings have their reason from a musical perspective, so they should usually be followed.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Princess Elisabeth-Philippine of France, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They set off back to Paris by carriage, which surrounded the turbulent crowd and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to let the windows of their carriage be thrown wide open.
In a moment at Versailles, a member of a criminal group shook the head of the royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to cover a large portion of the expenses, with the interest from the bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses on Wall Street.
Extra profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, represent the basic return of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, from the 11th to the 13th century (1000–1300 AD).
The early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, which, according to most opinions, ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technological push or technological imperative, or even the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervading logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that significantly transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "impact" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
We can, for example, say that when motor vehicles appear, it necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, which drives the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism incorporated a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the center of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was known as the center of fashion in feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted roughly until 1100 AD.
Its significance diminished during the twelfth century, particularly because the participants in the Crusades brought valuables back to Europe, such as silk and spices, which fetched a higher price at home than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this very time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, dresses were significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication, however, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of this period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of only that amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system utilizing native seeds from a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, which still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in terms of the age, ethnic background, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their affiliation through the conspicuous and symbolic use of a style that encompasses clothing, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the meaning of socialization is drawing on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, unfortunate accidents, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children were long-term imprisoned (usually by their own parents), and in some cases lived abandoned because their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals, while it is claimed that some lived in the wild on their own.
When completely raised by uncivilized animals, a feral child exhibits nearly identical behavior (within physical limitations) as the animal that cares for it, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
The skeleton is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals undergoing the acquisition of new practice, such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a certain form of scaffolding, but so is a small staple in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual Constructions designed for analyzing, motivating, and explaining procedures that might be too demanding for the student themselves.
Children are often placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they do not receive proper nutrition, care, and upbringing, yet such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide for all needs that were not met in the home from which the child was previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet add another dimension to its use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "continuing interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in interpreting microsignals – facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, you can, thanks to the correct interpretation of microexpressions, determine whether the other person is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," suggested that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle differences between the two sets in both directions within each generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to humans, it is difficult to satisfy their amino acid needs from plant sources available in open savannas.
If they do not do so, it will have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based sources to access would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it today on the savanna.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up from normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
It's easily achievable by using a relatively quiet alarm that gently wakes you up without fully waking you.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm from bed, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Further options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as it forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
The measure of a person's inner peace corresponds to the opposite of the measure of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more life force brings good. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is attainable by everyone. The only things standing in the way of reaching this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are fundamentally very simple. They are Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the postures of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries with the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for another 40 years, and proxy wars were actually fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and regrouping of forces along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were virtually scrapped overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after soldiers attacked eastern areas of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of a navy consisted in ensuring the state's ability to transport people and goods, but also in defending against the enemy preventing them from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often guarded by shepherds, sometimes from the ranks of children or adolescents, much like the better-known sheep herders. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Horse-drawn tramways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although coach roads were usually made up of only parallel planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve greater speed and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
In Prague, they were introduced quite early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually discovered that the tracks were more effective if they had a band of iron on their surface.
It became a common occurrence, but iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transport was walking, with people beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor Australopithecus generally did not walk upright.
Bipeds appear in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
In order to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can live more sustainably, join environmental protection movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not only aiming for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological progress of humankind, and problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks further to the printing house of John Dunlap.
Overnight, somewhere between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are currently known as "Dunlap prints."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8th on the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. One of the copies arrived in London on August 10th.
The oldest known surviving examples of the document are known as Dunlap broadsides, totaling 25 impressions from the Dunlap printing house. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many features in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are represented as binary digits – or in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions in case of the specific poison.
The term "brouk" is used in entomology for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both earwigs and woodlice are cunning, adapted to living in nests or the homes of their hosts.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known, making it the leading neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide on an adoption plan for their child.
In the event of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is, in fact, a guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not experimentation in and of itself. An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research, asking questions and making observations are also important.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run their free-flowing cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether germline cells were affected.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities during this type of hiking: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave the small towns, drive to work, and in the meantime, others pass them by who are heading to work from the place where they themselves just left.
On this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone participates in and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely encounter such a high level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something deeper?
Operation is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, analyzing traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, designing, and operating transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
In today's world, dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because a person doesn't feel that the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river in the world. It carries more than eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical precision of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined even with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. However, there are also metals like silver and gold, of course.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and incidental uses with the advent of new writing methods.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't get any contact with a paper cutter at all.
One can only marvel at what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission nuclear bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to keep a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's something like pulling a heavy cart uphill. Then, by redividing the atomic nucleus, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay upon even slight or no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the far side and around 100 km thick on the near side.
Under the sea, it is weaker, and under the mountains, it is stronger.
On the closer side, there may be more monthly seas because the crust is thinner here. Lava could therefore have reached the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on determining what resonates with people or is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt as their own during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do, and what in their environment prompts them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior may emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues – peers. At one end of the spectrum is the effort to remain "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluation, assigning accountability, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels they must change everything the team does and do it their own way.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This negotiation often leads to disagreements between management and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a so-called "invisible team" (Larson – LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional components of the organization, creativity and ingenuity may emerge.
The result is that the process of collaborating organizations to overcome an obstacle can lead to new and innovative processes for serving customer needs.
In order for the organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative corporate culture, implement knowledge sharing, and foster organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition. This, in turn, narrows and clarifies this area of research.
Scientists in their research are supported by the interconnectedness between brain disorders and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and cognitive adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent action.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in areas such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs, and are built into a variety of applications on home computers and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Students from Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their trip to the state capital every year. They revise the website each year, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Blogs can improve students' written expression. Although their blogging is often marked by careless spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to stay informed about the world around them." The need to spark public interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (This, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "enables students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their viewpoint on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada offering a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauty of the Muskoka region and others await discovery.
All of this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered a typical part of Canada by newcomers.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people will be surprised by the following statistic about the population: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, from a wildlife perspective, it can be considered a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. It thrived in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route (the Cape Route) from Europe to India.
To the north lies a region bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers be listed as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also good to wear a ring (just be careful it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment, and it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while she walks, grab her hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar l'Bayda, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of spices, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any trips outside the city should be well-planned, considering the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for excursions to Mount Nyiragongo and offers one of the cheapest gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxis). The usual price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is a impoverished city today, but thanks to its reputation it is a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites due to desert sand.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS program "Africa" hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, as it appears more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of the Republic of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similarly to all the National Parks of the Republic of South Africa, a park entrance fee and a conservation contribution are required here as well.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider a major travel destination.
The display of buildings that make up the Hong Kong cityscape is likened to a shimmering bar graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are obtained if you leave the island and head to the opposite waterfront of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists appropriated, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A portion of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining sections of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans region covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, we recommend purchasing your ticket several days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clear height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and operations did not begin until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani people were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area known today as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of India," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous inhabitants.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, take a look at the Argentina Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value corresponds to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in the town of Stanley.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on remote islands, but you might have luck with British and US currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so make the exchange before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30 °C are common here during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively frosty: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but combined with wind and air humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific periods of "rain" and "drought" here: The amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to people, they are still wild animals living in the wilderness and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Although they look peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, many visitors get injured due to not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so please give them their space.
Also keep in mind that bears and other animals in the wild are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the location of a poorly-known naval blockade in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships, except for one British battleship, were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During efforts for independence, peaceful gatherings in the city culminated in the killing of the highest president named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches given that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with the possibility of safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by holm oaks.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes populated family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water is safe to drink here, but if you prefer, bottled water is readily available.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but first-class.
Throughout the year, many trips to the cliffs and injuries are undertaken, and injuries resulting from one of these causes are rare.
So, heed the advice of authorities, follow the instructions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Tetrapods are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy. They can occasionally be found outside of this period.
Sharks really exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river mouth north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travelers the assurance that they will have a place to stay at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through them.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider or to arrange further documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any modifications or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of visitors decide to camp directly on the premises, and most of those participating consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of things, you'll need to arrive as soon as possible to get a spot in the camping area, which is located near the music stage.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, music may continue in other sections of the festival until late at night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you travel across the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as sailing through ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
St. Petersburg sightseeing cruises include time in the city. Visa requirements do not apply to passengers of sightseeing cruises (see terms and conditions).
Casinos mostly try to make guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it's often difficult to find an exit.
They typically have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep visitors in good spirits and within the casino premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication negatively affects judgment, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make driving impossible.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or frost or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Snow and ice, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and operations continue without major disruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists it represents the highlight of their trip.
The term safari, in the common understanding of the word, denotes overland travel for the purpose of viewing impressive African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment therefore allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and servals are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better with binoculars.
A tourist safari consists of a hike lasting several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was a host in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, this situation may be difficult for you.
Cancellation policies may vary, but even at the end of March, most cancellation policies related to coronavirus did not apply to July 2020, which was the planned date for the Olympic Games.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets priced at 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help him dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they aren't directly in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, even burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should buy bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Difficult insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or in worse cases, allergic reactions, the spread of toxins, or the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can seriously injure or kill a person are generally not classified as pests.
Shopping duty-free offers the opportunity to buy goods免税 and free from taxes and other charges in designated areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts, particularly when purchasing products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh offers the most challenging driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep angles, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are prevalent.
The maximum speed limit here is significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections – usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and its strict observance is even more important.
Interestingly, however, the mobile phone services here work much better than in many sections of the road, for example, in the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, very similar to those of their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular pastries are often best enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try some hearty sweets, try, for example, cakes which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Kari is a dish made from various herbs, spices, meat, or vegetables.
Kari can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and in some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without further specification, this term usually refers to a cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, features many simply seasoned dishes in which the flavors of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices prevail.
The stirrups hanging on both sides of the saddle serve as support for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can be linked to safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their leg gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run away, it can drag the rider along. A number of safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, relatively narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety latches that allow the stirrup strap to release from the saddle if the falling rider pulls on it.
The Chochamó Valley – a popular mountaineering destination known as the Yosemite of South America, favored by the Chilean president, where vast granite walls and cliffs can be found.
Mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world constantly establish new routes thanks to the endless potential of these walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts sometimes known as "ski wanderers," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century as a sport. The first recreational ski club opened in Norsia, Australia, in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski trips.
Does it have anything to do with alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, whereas the latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots?
Imagine a ski slope as being similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than on foot – but you'll rarely move at the speed you'd achieve cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on a groomed track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly going through visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this regard similarly to a single country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which will save you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured object an antique. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition has geographical variations, where, for example, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Responsible breeding is an important livelihood for Sámy, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sámi traditionally dedicated themselves to large-scale reindeer herding; they also made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern crafts. Tourism represents an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is used extensively, especially among non-Romani populations, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes subject to travel advisories, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You might prefer to look at the advice of other governments than your own, but it is primarily intended for their own citizens.
American citizens can serve as an example, facing different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory services are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a given country.
The presented opinions are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and takes various forms that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Sudden wind, hail, heavy rainfall, and fires are manifestations and consequences of severe weather, such as storms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all possible risks of adverse weather in their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Internet searches for the term "Course for Hostile Environments" will likely find the address of a local company.
The course typically addresses all the problems described here in much greater detail, often including practical exercises.
The course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes training based on role-playing, thorough first aid instruction, and sometimes also weapon handling.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the requested name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies.
Security checks became much more disruptive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through scanners and that their privacy and dignity will remain unharmed.
Rip currents are returning waves that break on the beach, often at the location of a reef, etc.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in several deeper sections, and it is here that a rapid current into deep water can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere the current won't pull you under again, or, depending on your abilities and whether they've noticed you, it's better to wait for help.
The shock of returning comes sooner than the cultural shock (there's a smaller phase of initial excitement), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience readjusting to their native culture.
After returning from a stay abroad, you are accustomed to a new culture and have already shed some habits from home.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not realize that travelers returning home need patience and understanding too.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence even before the show begins.
Typically, you constantly hear tourists and vendors here. The story of sounds and lights is reminiscent of a fairy tale book.
The sphinx functions as both a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the individual pyramids are illuminated one after another.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases – in 2020, there were 16 active ones there.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among these are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or on the ridge of Sentinel lies the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with its 4892-meter-high Mount Vinson peak.
In remote locations without mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, because to make a call, you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight between yourself and the satellite.
This service is often used by maritime transport, including recreational vessels and expeditions that require remote data.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off.
It is especially popular with people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after graduating from high school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition is typically charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
It's not necessarily essential to have a yacht on the islands and lakes.
Although the archipelago and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every seven to eight people here.
Similarly, it's the case in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's completely unique (for example, in the Netherlands this number is number one out of forty).
Cruises on the Baltic Sea usually include a longer stay in Russian St. Petersburg.
This means you can visit this historic town for several full days and return to the ship at night to sleep on it.
If you disembark only as part of organized cruises, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some trips in the brochure include German Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the trip.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight, or if they have a previous traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal worries and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or the feeling that the situation is out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies own their own aircraft, but a problem arose on other routes and with smaller companies.
If they were to ship the items by air freight, it could take several days for them to clear customs and go through unloading on some routes.
The only way to handle it faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly first or business class is to withdraw a thick wad of cash (it's even better to have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the price of a regular economy ticket in business class and eleven times the price in first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on flights from point A to point B for first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of travelers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and prices reflect this.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldavia is a multi-ethnic republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of around 3.7 million, is the third largest city in Turkey, after Istanbul, and also the second largest port and an important transportation hub.
What was once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interwoven with traditional roofs of red tiles, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
At the cemetery, you can see interesting marble dove statues above some of the graves.
A half-hour walk through this interesting village is worth it.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners thanks to its beauty, described by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb network bus number 403 goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site and also a place that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
To this day, many men and women who survived internment at this place still live, and even more those whose loved ones were murdered or died of exhaustion from forced labor here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please behave with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect that this place deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or by scratching graffiti into the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the inhabitants prefer Catalan, a significant majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and inscriptions are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Spanish is, however, commonly used in public transport and other facilities. **Note:** The original Czech sentence appears to be a mix of Czech and Spanish. Assuming the intention was to translate the Spanish part only, this is the translation. If the whole sentence was meant to be Czech, please provide the correct Czech version.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, however, unscheduled service disruptions are announced by an automated system in many different languages – Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant people.
Although it often boils down to an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave as well as possible, in other words, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). All your actions will make it considerably easier.
The initial impression that Parisians are somewhat brusque quickly fades if you show at least basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and linden, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, varied soil, and different altitudes, significantly different plant communities grow there.
The region is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Besides many more common species, rare fauna can also be found here, such as brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and grouse.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide blankets for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own blanket, especially a colorful one, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are obliged to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. They only come in one size for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to the cuisine of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and often makes use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredients, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, together with the pronoun Sie (you), are always written with a capital letter at the beginning, and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It likely also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively straightforward because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters to be careful with are C and G, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also be careful of the different pronunciations of the letters "r" and "rr": "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "car/chariot".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
If you read these grammar basics, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand individual phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern era are now mostly obsolete and serve as museums or educational centers.
Because light pollution at their peak wasn't such a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, making them more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take away even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will be thrown out without question for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to stay in. You can also easily get around there, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, given that it is located in the "tropical zone" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with heat (always) and intense sun (with clear skies, less often).
Some buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on vacation.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire and Rhine valleys, or a tour of interesting cities on the Danube, or a cruise on the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday were adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition in which people stay awake on Easter night at a prominent location to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it could just as easily be pre-Christian spring and fertility festivals.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often bursts into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got there by swimming, flying, or were brought there by the wind or sea currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to overcome this distance, and on the Galapagos Islands, the giant tortoise became the dominant grazing animal.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, a number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you may experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a suitable opportunity to observe the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for the most part.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is usually not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
The standard attire of a businessman is a suit, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is key; rather than praising individual achievements, group effort is emphasized.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
