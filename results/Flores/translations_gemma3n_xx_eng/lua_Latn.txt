Here's a translation attempting to capture the meaning, acknowledging the potential for multiple interpretations: "The things that exist in the world, because of the things that are always happening, are revealed in this way: that the things of life, which are filled with the taste of bitter disappointment and the sorrows of those who are afflicted and those who are not afflicted, are like a powerful, widespread disease affecting people in all kinds of ways, from head to toe." **Explanation of Challenges & Choices:** * **"Diunvuija dia kudi baabunyi bua ditantshishibua edi didi difila ngenyi minena ibidi"**: This opening is quite abstract. "Diunvuija dia kudi" could refer to the essence or nature of the world. "Baabunyi bua ditantshishibua" refers to things that are happening/occurring. "Didi difila ngenyi minena ibidi" describes the reveal of these things. * **"se ditantshishibua dia ngenyi nkayadi didi dilonda citupa cilepa panyima pa bienzedi biabu anyi bienzedi bia balombodi"**: This part speaks to the experience of life being filled with both bitter disappointment and sorrow. "Citupa cilepa panyima" likely describes the nature of this disappointment. * **"ne ditanta edi mudipingaja didi ne "bipeta" mu miaba ya midimu bidi bikala munda, pamutu pa kansungasunga"**: The "bipeta" could be translated as affecting or impacting. The idea is that this experience is pervasive and affects people greatly, from head to toe. "Kansungasunga" refers to the totality of human existence. The overall meaning is about the pervasive nature of suffering and disappointment in the world, affecting everyone deeply.
