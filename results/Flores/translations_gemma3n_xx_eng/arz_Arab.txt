It doesn't just confirm that some dinosaurs, at the very least, had feathers, which is a well-known theory, but it also provides details that fossils can't offer in general, like color and the arrangement which has three dimensions.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carrot-colored on the underside.
The discovery allows us to gain a deep understanding of the topic of feather growth in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a long, big spine like we see in other animals, but there are other characteristics in the feathers, like bumps and spines. However, researchers have found that the spine was mostly something that developed later as a result of these other characteristics evolving.
The structure of the wings indicates they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers say that even though these dinosaurs were small, the specimen shows that the feathers were large, not small.
The researchers said that even though this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers from an adult bird, not chick feathers.

However, the work that was completed is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations that were recorded about the Milky Way galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for was caused by tidal forces from islands located between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just like the moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, and also the Milky Way attracts the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists have figured out that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory clarifies that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists around it, forming a halo, composed of tiny particles in huge numbers.

In France, voting traditionally was a rather low-tech experience: voters would isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot showing their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the officials check the voter's ID, they have the voter put the ballot in the ballot box and sign the voting log.

Since 1988, it became necessary for ballot boxes to be transparent so that voters and observers could be sure that there were no pre-filled envelopes at the start of voting, and that no envelopes were added except for those of registered voters who are authorized according to regulations.
Candidates can send representatives on their behalf to observe every part of the process. At night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

Three more bombs exploded near government buildings within two hours.
Some reports said the official death toll reached eight, but reports issued by the government confirm that the number of infections is 30, and the final numbers are not known yet.
They found cyanide acid and melamine in urine samples of pets that died after eating contaminated pet food.
Researchers at the university say that the two compounds react with each other to form crystals that could prevent kidney function.
Researchers have noticed crystals forming in cat urine when melamine and cyanuric acid are added.
The crystal formation matches the composition of urine from pets infected with the disease, when compared using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
I don't know if you know about this or not, but most of the goods coming from Central America enter this country without taxes.
Despite that, taxes are imposed on eighty percent of our exports of goods through customs tariffs in Central American countries, just as we treat you.
That wasn't logical to me; and definitely wasn't fair.
All that I will say to the people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger enacted a law prohibiting the sale or rental of video games containing violent scenes.
The bill mandates that violent video games sold in the state of California must have a label stating "18" on them, and imposes a $1000 fine for each violation, as well as on those who sell them to minors.
The Public Prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, said in a statement this morning announcing the trial of Hony and Price.
He resigned and they will replace him in the Cabinet with Member of Parliament, Ed Davey. It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will take over the position of Minister of Business, which Davey will leave.
They will meet Hohen and Bryce at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 18th.
Among the casualties were Nicolas Aldin, who was 25 years old, and Zakary Koudibac, who was 21 years old. Koudibac was working as a driver.
Edgar Vigilola was injured in his arm and jaw by Christopher Schneider and needed reconstructive surgery.
Schneider is suffering from persistent pain, blindness in one eye, and the loss of a part of his skull, with his face rebuilt from titanium. All of this happened when a weapon pointed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a US Air Force base located in his country.
Karbanido entered two singles matches in the championship because of what we saw on Wednesday.
The first race I participated in was the slalom skateboarding race, but my result was enough to win from the first round. I got 36 out of 116 competitors with the same result in the race.
In the second race, which was the giant slalom skiing race, I got tenth place in the women's sitting group after running a time of 4:41.30. That was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Luchs, who got first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gjonji Dani, who got ninth place.
In the women's race, four competitors did not finish, and 45 out of 117 competitors did not score points in the giant slalom race.
The police are asking you to return the stolen computer and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General K. Aria said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we returned her cell phone and laptop to her."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kangar, Botha Kanga, Ramبرو Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the defendants stood before the court with cloths covering their faces.

Initially, he completely entered James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And after that, he went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that point on, they accused Adikoya of murdering her son in the Shريف إدنبرة court.
She's detained as a precaution and is waiting for charges to be filed and for her trial, but any evidence from a witness could be fabricated because her picture has already been widely publicized.
This is a popular practice in other places in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts considered that publishing the photos could be incitement to hatred.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University said that "it seems to me that journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or something similar like this concerning suspects."
The office of the Minister Responsible for Trials stated to journalists that he will not comment further, at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document indicates a disagreement on the borders, with Palestine referring to the borders as they were before the war that happened in the Middle East in 1967.
The other topics that are said to have been covered include the status of Jerusalem in the future, which is an important issue for both peoples and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel is asking for the continuation of military presence in the Golan Heights for ten years, as soon as an agreement is expected, but the Palestinian Authority agrees that this presence will only continue for five years.

Marty delivered the oath yesterday in a new temporary electoral council consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth temporary council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee ordered the resignation of the interim electoral council, and this is part of a set of measures to organize new elections in the country.
The committee was like Martelli's response to the large protests against the regime, and it started in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, emerged due to the failure to hold elections that were supposed to take place since 2011.
A report was filed regarding approximately 60 defects and overheating of an iPod, which caused nearly six fires and four people were injured with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of the 27 incidents related to the devices.

One of the people who work at the tsunami warning center in the Pacific Ocean said there are no indications that a tsunami could occur.
A police officer dared to act within the government to kidnap tourists coming from Hong Kong and take them hostage after he kidnapped their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire from his M16 rifle on tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six have died so far.
Six prisoners were released early, including children, elderly people, and also Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the restroom, and then they opened fire on Mendoza.
Leighaniz followed in his father's footsteps, and medicine became his profession.
He trained to become an obstetrician and worked at Oakland Women's Hospital in 1959.
Legens started researching premature births in his free time, when he was working at the hospital.
His research showed that taking the hormone could make the fetus's lungs grow quickly.
Shenkhawa said that government investigators recovered the flight recorders, also known as the black box, on Wednesday.
The wrestling colleagues praised Luna too.
Tomy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extremist queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, unparalleled."
Dustin "Goldust" Rollins said, "Luna was weird like me... and maybe even weirder than me... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased from 8% in 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should be a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who were in the survey agree with this viewpoint, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
In the latest survey results that came to us, 29 percent saw that Australia needs to become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent saw that Australia absolutely cannot become a republic.
The fitness level of the Olympic gold medalist in swimming is now in question due to his complaints, as he was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He can't take the medicine he needs to overcome his pain because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, who works in mathematics and is a professor of computer science at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, succeeded in discovering the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
A few people verified the discovery and used different devices and programs starting at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are considered a source for delivering water to Earth, alongside organic matter that could form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists have hope of understanding how planets form, especially how Earth formed from the impact of comets with Earth a long time ago.
Koumou, who is 53 years old, started his rule at the beginning of this year and a bill passed last month allowing same-sex marriage was overturned.
He said that these rumors are just "trivial political things and nonsense."
It is expected that he will nominate himself for the presidency in 2016.
The next generation is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow pilots to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
She uses a system that links satellites, unlike the old system where ground radar was used to help air traffic controllers precisely locate pilots and provide them with very specific information.
There won't be any additional transportation, and local public transport trains won't stop at Wembley, and there won't be parking for cars or facilities for gardens or transportation around the stadium.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without fans in attendance.
There's a study that was published on Thursday in the journal Science saying that a new type of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the development of new species continued for two generations, although they thought the process would take a very long time due to the breeding between the Darwin's finch endemic to the area, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the ground finch with a single beak.
Gold can be manufactured in all possible forms, and it can also be damaged into smaller shapes.
You can pull it on a thin wire, you can wrap it and tear it apart, and you can also strike it or wrap it into sheets.
We could make it very thin, and stick it onto another metal. And it could be thin to the point that it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
We call this the pH of the chemical substance. Can you make an indicator using red cabbage juice?
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H symbol in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Slightly moisten the powdered dry ingredients and squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, and this gives you a strange feeling and creates a type of coating.
My cities Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a flushing mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sanitation systems were found in homes in the cities of Mykonos in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were at certain times part of public baths because men and women would go there together in a mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost at the same time.
The satellite went to space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
The matter requires a giant rocket, longer than 100 feet, to deploy a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in an unbelievable way, but providing an easier and faster means of transportation is the most important thing it contributed to for us.
We have trains, cars, and many other types of transportation.
Among them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
At the end of the topic, there are small cats (including stray domestic cats) eating small prey, which is more numerous, like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The reason for their success was the concept of status – a special function to ensure each cat doesn't compete with the others.
Black cats are the most social cats and live in large groups called packs.
The Black family has one to three adult males, and besides that, there are thirty females and a cub.
Normally, the females are close to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave like groups of wolves or dogs, and they are very similar in behavior to lions (but not other large cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
Because he's a distinguished athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), and can swim, jump long distances, and also pull with a strength equivalent to a human five times.
The tiger stays in the same group (tiger species) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. And those four are the only ones who can make a roar.
A lion's roar isn't like a lion's roar with full volume, but it's closer to being like a shout with angry words.
Dwarf tigers love to eat small animals, and they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the dwarf tiger hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that caracal cats track and find animals that eat them (prey) using their sense of smell; and they also smell their locations in the ground.
You can see well in the dark using night vision, and they also move stealthily. Also, dwarf cheetahs hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group they came from (for example, when they migrate across a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island and can't easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one before.
Because this new environment has different resources and competitors, this newly formed group will need different qualities or adaptation methods to be a stronger competitor compared to the strength it needed before.
There hasn't been any change to the indigenous population at all; they still need the same adaptation methods we learned about them.
As time goes by and new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarities with the other residents gradually decrease.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will become so different that we won't even call them the same type.
This process is called speciation, and it simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered a deterministic result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals can't live without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator in its time, that's why it wasn't afraid of anything except other Mosasaurs.
Her long jaws had more than 70 teeth like blades, and another set in the roof of her mouth, which means there's no solution to anything that stands in her way.
I don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, and other dinosaurs, and he might have been a carnivore.
Bardo attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex didn't stop her.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of unusual or exotic holiday dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the zaghba.
There was also something different, which is that the poor and women would eat their food while sitting on chairs, whereas the rich liked to set up tables and eat in a more formal way, leaning on their sides while eating their meals.
It wasn't possible for ancient Roman meals to include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have pomegranates, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of the gods and considered it the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs during celebrations and holidays.
In every temple, there's an open courtyard that contains a secure sanctuary, and only the priests are allowed inside it.
At times, they would build distinctive towers in the shape of pyramids called ziggurats to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house has no importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open stalls overlooking the street. Stone was used in building the houses.
There weren't any large forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was expensive.
Humans settled in Greenland scatteredly. In the Scandinavian sagas, it's told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Without looking at his discovery, Inuit tribes were living in these areas.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might feel like a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not correct. Even though there's something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence was written on its back with the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." And the text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is unknown, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
That's why, the code might have been added as a very simple label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
She was under the rule of the French "Vichy" regime. Those people were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France, and they were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, meaning a community.
The origin of the word "civilization" is the Latin word "civilis," and its meaning is "civil," which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city or the state of the city." This also defines it in terms of the social group.
The country-city is the first step in building nations. Civilized culture, in essence, is the transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next and a cultural imprint that is favored and distributed fairly.
Often, lesser-known cultures end without any real historical evidence, and they aren't recognized as actual civilizations.
During the time of the independence war, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with the Congress as its only component along with the articles of the federal system.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, they were relying on the state authorities, which were mostly not cooperating at all to enforce any of its laws.
She didn't even have authority to bypass tax and customs laws between the states.
The materials required that it be agreed upon by all the governorates before it is modified, and the governorates mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team, and also the German national football team, are among the most successful teams in the world, and they were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), and that makes Japan the seventh-largest island country in the whole world!
Due to the group/system of islands present in Japan, they used to say that from a geographical perspective, Japan is an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its journey back in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by it wrote the name of the island "Formosa," or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing the practices of producing native grains and employing Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) armies controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu city has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how it originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration work is still ongoing to this day.
For example, the most common format for capturing still images in the world is 35mm, which is the most widespread film format at the end of the era of analog film.
Production is still ongoing to this day, but more importantly than that is that the image sensor unit in digital cameras inherited the aspect ratio (width to height).
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratios in this image should be (either divided by 12 to get the ratio as the simplest whole numbers) so it will be 3:2.
It equals or is close to many common formats (like the Advanced Image System formats), the aspect ratio.
The rule of tripling that they use poorly, and which many people mock, forms a simple guiding principle that works to create dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear form.
The most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (for example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under the scrutiny of investigative authorities during this period of European history.
Christianity linked European countries together for more than a thousand years, even though they are different in language and custom.
The comprehensive power that he possessed had an impact on all people, from the king down to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money in the church exists specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this focus on power and money has led many people to question whether this doctrine is achieving its goals.
Britain quickly moved to blockade Germany by sea after skirmishes and clashes emerged.
The strategy has proven effective; vital military and civilian supplies have been cut off, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, which was written and coordinated in a number of international agreements during the past two centuries.
Britain planted a mine in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the oceans, and this is a move that threatens even neutral ships.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, I expected Germany to respond similarly to its own unrestricted submarine war.
In the 1920s, peace and isolation were the stance favored by most citizens and nations.
After we saw the disasters that World War I brought, the country wanted to avoid it happening again later.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batcheller (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of doing things, and it's amazing! They refer to specific periods in history; each period of China, or each dynasty in power, was a different kind of thing.
There was a period of instability, with provinces divided among each family. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the House of Han and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, a strong war broke out between many nobles who wanted to reach the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to sit in the highest seats in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
The social and political changes are many, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute rule to a republic, nationalism, and the conviction that the state belongs to the people, not just one leader.
Even after the revolution, jobs were plentiful for young men, and this was an opportunity for those with bigger dreams to get ahead.
The same thing happened in the army because instead of the army's classifications being based on rank, now they depend on weaponry.
The French Revolution also had a significant impact on many oppressed members of the working class, as well as in other countries, inspiring them to start their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was very interested in things that transcend this life in this world. And he used to go to a cave called Hira' atop Mount al-Nour (the Mountain of Light) to meditate.
The laurel that the Prophet entered and that remains present in every era presents itself as a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it's not easy at all to find him, even if you know he's there. As soon as he enters the cave, he's in complete isolation.
You can't see anything except the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. And you can hardly see or hear anything but a few things inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one still existing of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World to this day.
The Great Pyramid that the pharaohs built in the 3rd century BC is a large pyramidal structure built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis City" located in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "acute accent" looks like the letter V, and the "grave accent" looks like a staple or a square where the bottom side is missing.
An upward mark indicates that you should start from the end and push the bow, while a downward mark means you must start from the beginning of the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull it.
The top bow usually produces a softer sound, whereas the bottom bow is stronger and a bit more intense.
Don't hesitate to draw your markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed curved markings are there for musical reasons, so you have to consider them.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their young children (Marie-Thérèse who was 11 years old and Louis-Charles who was 4 years old), and the King's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced in October 1789 to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, and a large crowd of people were surrounding them, shouting and cheering against the King and Queen.
A group of fans succeeded in forcing the King and Queen to open their car windows all the way.
One of the guys in the gang, at a specific time, brandishes the head of one of the members of the Royal Guard who were killed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the price for the American imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay their taxes to the American colonial regime in order to bear a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the huge profits coming from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are what will constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivates the creation of the organization, so that we can understand the Knights of the Temple.
The era in which all the events happened was the High Middle Ages, which is the period in European history from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, all of which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses the practical application of a wide range of ideas, ranging from technological dynamism or technological necessity to the strict viewpoint that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has an "impact" on the deeply ingrained and socially unconditioned culture of society.
For example, one could say that the car engine contributes to the development of bridges.
Establishing a road network across the country is useless economically just for a few cars; that's why they are developing new roads to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accident rates, and this causes the invention of new methods in healthcare to treat bodies that have been injured.
The romance was based on a large element of cultural determinism that they draw from books like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
As romantic movement progressed, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography developed. Those who were in harmony with their community's place were better off than laws that were imposed forcibly.
Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the world now, but Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe during the era of feudalism.
It is known for being the center of luxury, starting in the year 400 AD and continuing until the year 1100 AD.
Her condition weakened primarily during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts like silk and spices, which had a higher value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
But at that time, Paris became the capital of fashion instead of Constantinople.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothes were very influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Even so, and due to the slow pace of communication channels, the situations in the West could be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, due to the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming whose goal is only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming - usually organic - is a simple system where seeds from storage that are suitable for the region's ecosystem are used. Alongside this, crop rotation or other simple techniques are employed to increase yields.
Most farmers used to work in agriculture for subsistence, and this situation continues in many developing countries.
Subcultures work to connect people with similar thought patterns and those who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures can be distinguished due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define the distinctiveness of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through their use of a style that includes clothing, affectation, and jargon in a symbolic way, with distinctiveness.
Among the common ways they use to illustrate the significant role that socialization plays, is that they rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered from neglect, bad luck, or intentional harm, and who were socially isolated from adults while they were growing up.
These children are often called "the wild ones" or the feral ones. Some stray children have been detained by people (usually their parents); in some cases, they were abandoned because the parents refused to accept the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
The feral children may have been subjected to mistreatment during their childhood, or they may have experienced severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
There are doubts that other animals raised them; and some say that some lived in the wild alone.
When a child is raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within material limits) that strongly resemble the behaviors of a domesticated animal, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn't a method of learning, but rather a supportive tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and physical, and also, the teacher is considered a form of interactive learning, as well as a paperclip icon in Microsoft Office.
Internal learning within the program is supported internally, and its goal is to pose questions, encourage, and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed under the care of the state because they face things like neglect, harm, and even extortion.
It's completely unacceptable for any child to grow up in an environment that doesn't prioritize nurturing, care, and education, but they do it anyway.
We know that foster care is a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care needs to provide all the necessary things they lost in the homes they came from previously.
The internet combines elements of mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the concept of "uses and benefits."
For example, some people say that learning and socialization are fundamental drivers for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships have been identified as new motivating factors, according to Aimi and McCord (1998) in their study of audience response to websites.
Using video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements lasting only fractions of a second.
It is specifically said that a person can discover if someone is lying not by interpreting subtle expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, stated that the president's message suggests that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He proposes the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: one extinct and the other apparent.
The boom adds new genetic diversity, but selection removes it from the pool of phenotypic variation.
The separation and reassembly processes allow for random variation to go back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, the major mammals there, which have digestive systems like humans, have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Your failure to do that will lead to dangerous consequences, such as stunted growth and malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that were easily accessible were proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for humans like us to digest if they aren't cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
When we put everything in our minds, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" they had in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep disruption is when you wake up intentionally during your sleep, after sleeping for a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
It's possible to do that easily by using a soft alarm that gradually wakes you up without fully waking you from your sleep.
If you find yourself fiddling with the clock again while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, and that will force you to get out of bed to stop it.
Options based on biological rhythm include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positivity you get from the power of life it gives you. And every person has the hidden ability to enjoy lasting peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach what they want. But the only thing that stops us from reaching our goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of Buddha, but it has extended through the Mahayana path of love and other methods taken from Hindu Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The Tibetan meditation center is like the god Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels get cleansed, the chakras are activated, and awareness is created for enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and America, but when the war ended, differences in systems, procedures, and cultures caused conflict to reappear between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the Allies used to be enemies, and now the Cold War has begun.
It was supposed that this war would continue for the next forty years, and the fighting would be on the ground, through proxy armies coming from Africa and Asia, present in the battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Vistula River.
Despite that, these plans became outdated overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland. This was a violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Agreement, and other international treaties, both bilateral and involving many parties.
Using ships to transport these goods is the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy was traditionally to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, and at the same time, to hinder your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the modern examples that needs to be noted is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
The German navy was trying to prevent the occupation by using submarines at that time.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have most likely been able to reach Britain the way it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time in approximately 10,000 years in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used it to easily get to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
The domestic goats used to be raised in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and mostly they were herded by goat herders who were children or teenagers, like the well-known shepherd. And these grazing methods are still used to this day.
The horse-drawn carriages in England were built in the 16th century.
Even though the old train cars were just wooden planks piled on top of each other, the horses had the opportunity to pull them to make them fast and also to pull heavy loads, especially if we compare that to the roads at the time, which were very rough.
The crossbeams were put in right away to fix the rails in place. But little by little they realized that if they installed an iron bar above the tracks, it would improve its efficiency.
That became a common knowledge, but iron caused corrosion to the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they installed the first complete iron rails.
Walking was the first means of transportation, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago, which was the time when Homo erectus (upright man) appeared.
Australopithecus ancestors didn't walk upright like they were used to.
Also, there are groups with evidence of bipedalism in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus might have walked upright from seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
That's exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. And even so, if you don't just want a temporary fix, we need to find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It's clear that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and artistic human progress, and problems have become bigger because of population growth and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After the Congress announced on July 4th that there was a draft written in handwriting, signed by the Speaker of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, it was taken to John Dunlap's printing house, and then followed by some of the buildings.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Denlab Monetary Leaflets."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them followed George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The folds of the 25-dollar bill represent the oldest surviving copies of the US Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is missing.
Many paleontologists today are confident that a single group of dinosaurs survived and is living today. We call them birds.
People often don't think of them as dinosaurs just because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still like dinosaurs.
They have feet with external protective layers and claws, and they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
All computers currently in use, whether desktops or laptops, rely on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers – or bits – if we're talking about computer language.
Internal poisoning might not show its symptoms in time. An immediate diagnosis isn't possible until we have a sufficient general set of symptoms like vomiting.
The best indicator of poisoning inside could be an open container for medications or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the ticket to know the first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Insect scientists use the term "bed bug" in its official meaning to refer to these groups of insects.
This term comes from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have significantly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Deadly spiders and butterfly insects have characteristics like the length of their incubation period, and they can also live in a nest or the home of their host.
God alone blesses America; it has about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to be affected by multiple sclerosis as men.
There's a man and six people who think it's not in their interest, or in the interest of their young child, to raise a small child.
These couples might choose to create a construction plan for their children.
In an adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using a scientific approach. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite that, she isn't unique in this regard, and experimentation can be considered a test that can be used to get rid of one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, specifically the Gospel in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all scientific fields, even psychology.
When the level of knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many of the rhythms that are observed in physiology and behavior often heavily rely on the presence and production of internal cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are internal oscillators that work for a period of time with cycles following each other, even without external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the important pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to get their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to determine if it uses DNA for the Coxsackievirus using radioactive phosphorus, or Coxsackievirus protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are from germline cells or not.
But mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in another location may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife, plants, and animals.
Examples of activities you can do at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, filming, and observing orangutans in Borneo.
People drive from the smaller cities to their workplaces every morning, and they meet other people who work at the place they just left along the way.
And in this means of transportation that has vitality, each person supports and connects to a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this great economy, which relies on carbon, has disrupted the atmosphere from its stable state, and that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. And they all complain about the transportation systems.
It's rare to hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do the transportation systems cause these complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers not competent? Or is something else more important happening?
Traffic management means studying the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because it's not possible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers are always inclined to act rationally; and because of that, traffic tends to be balanced, and we can represent it approximately.
To clarify traffic flow better, there are relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and reach food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the feature of folding their wings backward along the length of their body.
This gives them a larger set of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
A long time ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people saw that he was right, but many saw the opposite, and that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and from it the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It has more water than the second longest river in the world – 8 times more.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth; sometimes its width reaches 6 miles.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from all the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River. Amazing!
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water coming from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building the pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing built has surpassed the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and artistic distinction.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were amazed by the آثار ( آثار - artifacts/remains) of those who came before them, and those that lasted more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the whole world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of everyday life that most people working in the country use, but Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of the Vatican are from the Roman Catholic group.
People knew that there were basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, so it was possible to discover all these elements in nature in their original form and it was possible to extract them relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that it transforms into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are originally a mixture containing two or more metals. And don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also other minerals like silver and gold.
It's possible to also take alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter, and all matter was created from tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are very small, so small that trillions of them could fit within the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Again, the pencil was a good friend because many people used it when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil's importance has diminished, and we don't use it except in few cases.
People nowadays can write messages on the computer screen without needing to use a typewriter.
A person can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the basis of gathering energy to become a core full of protons and neutrons.
It's like you're rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core cracks again, and a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and that means they tend to break apart with even a slight movement or without any movement.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The length of the Nile tilapia ( سمك القشرة) is approximately 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He is thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands region.
There might be many lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. And it was easier for lava to come out to the surface.
Content theories focus on people searching for what attracts and excites them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously as soon as they reach puberty.
These theories deal with the issue of what motivates people to do what they do, and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two types of behaviors that might appear when managers start leading their former colleagues. One of them is an attempt to remain "one of the colleagues" (or the others).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, a person transforms into someone you wouldn't recognize and feels they need to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
And after all of that, the leader is the one who bears the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual differences are subject to the same standards of distinction as traditional differences, but there are subtle differences.
Generally, the virtual team members act as a point of contact for their physical, immediate groups.
Often, they have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams can convene across different time zones that may not be understood through their local management.
Describing the actual hidden team as unparalleled, not like a hypothetical team (Larson & Lavasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is the management team that every member reports to, and it is responsible for setting the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that consumes a lot of time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are utilized effectively through functional departments within the organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
As a result of this, the cooperation within the organization to overcome difficulties might lead us to a new, innovative process that meets the client's needs.
Before the organization can be capable of innovation, the management needs to create this culture, like innovation, and knowledge sharing alongside education for the organization.
Angal (2006) explains a method called sustainability, and it's used to help organizations reach a high level of performance, sir.
The data associated with neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical framework when seeking knowledge. It thereby works to reduce the search area and make it very precise.
The connection between neurology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's well-known for a while now that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we haven't seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is very similar to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The search in artificial intelligence aims to make machines execute tasks in an automated way, and this requires a smart method.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions. It also allows you to recognize handwriting, voice, and facial features.
These things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are currently being used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they've also been used to create a range of software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any school term. Often, the teacher might like to accompany her students to places that can't be reached by bus.
Technology provides solutions through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts at the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in class.
Also, participating in a virtual field trip represents a wonderful way we can use to think about a trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School every year in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but they keep the old versions online as a record.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. And even though students often start their blogging journey with incorrect grammar and spelling, having an audience changes all that.
Since students are the most criticized audience in many times, the blogger tries to improve their writing so they won't be criticized.
Blogs also "force students to be smart with the world around them." There's an incentive to nurture audience interest, and that makes students skillful and useful (Toto, 2004).
Documentation is a tool that enables people to cooperate and encourages students to continue their education even after the regular school day.
Proper use of blogs makes students more analytical and critical through their effective response to online materials, defining their position on others' writings, and also presenting their own viewpoints on specific topics (Ourafic, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of the attractive country of Canada, which has two main languages and a few art exhibitions and museums showing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and the north is a place with natural beauty that is not exploited for Moscow and what lies behind it.
All these things and more are considered Ontario, as strangers see it, as if it originated from a Canadian Pasha.
Vast areas in the north with few inhabitants, and some are almost uninhabited.
To show the comparison regarding the population that amazes many people: the number of African American residents in America is greater than the Canadian citizens.
The islands east of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and it's considered an independent continent. We talked about the wildlife there.
Most of the small islands are either independent countries or affiliated with France, and their names are luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century was when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama succeeded in finding a route around the Cape that connects Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast surrounds the region, and the Atlantic Ocean surrounds it from the south and west.
Regarding women: Without looking at their actual marital status, women who are traveling must declare that they are married.
He's helping her put on a ring, but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to know that cultural differences can cause harassment and that it's common to follow them, and grab them by the arm, etc.
You have to be strong in front of men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or anything else don't make it acceptable!).
The city of New Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used as a strategic military outpost by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca, then they abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city in the name of Dar Bouida, and the Spanish merchants who established commercial posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca isn't one of the most attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods all over the city – like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all the cheap stuff – but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, situated in the far east, close to Rwanda.
The eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma in the year 2002, covering most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
Any visits outside of Goma need to be investigated so we can understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kiwu district, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is located to climb Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a boda boda (which is a motorcycle that works as a taxi) to explore the city of Goma, and the regular (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
The area of "Timbuktu" is used metaphorically to refer to strange, distant lands because they are difficult to reach.
Timbuktu is a poor city these days, despite its reputation that makes it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, they added sites of World Heritage that are threatened by danger to the list, because of the threat of desert sands.
One of the main episodes for Henry Lewis Gates on PBS was about the African Wonders.
The city has a significant contradiction compared to the rest of the country's cities, because its character is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, and it stretches parallel to the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 square kilometers, and it is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It's one of the areas that attracts in South Africa, and it's considered one of the best national parks in South Africa.
There are maintenance and entry fees imposed in the garden, like all the public gardens that exist in South Africa.
It's useful that you buy a Wildcard card, because it allows you to enter a selection of South African theme parks, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the region of Hong Kong its name, and it's a place considered a major tourist attraction by many tourists.
The buildings that are like the row that draws Hong Kong's skyline resemble a gleaming chart that appears above the waters of Victoria Harbor.
To see the best sights in Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the North Point Waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on land reclaimed along the entire northern coastline.
This is the place that the British colonizers used as their own, and that's why if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) into areas off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was announced to be a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is the part of the forest located in the Indian territories within the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just swamps because of mangrove trees; and they contain the latest evidence based on the dense thickets that covered the Ganges River in the past.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, approximately one-third of which is water and swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a refuge for wildlife, and there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses run from the bus station between the areas (via the river) all day, even though most of them, especially those going to the East and Jakar/Bomthang, run between 6:30 and 7:30.
The buses that travel between neighborhoods are packed, and it's best if you buy your tickets in advance, a few days before.
Most areas are served by coaster buses, which are small Japanese buses and are comfortable and strong.
These shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get around to places nearby, like Barou (Nu 150) and Bunakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high and 378 meters long, and they have two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it won't be open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to operate at full capacity in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are completed.
The Guarani were the most important native group inhabiting the region we now know as Eastern Paraguay, and they lived like hunters, somewhat like wanderers, and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guayaku and Payaguas, who lived on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was formerly known as the "Giant Province of Indians," arose in the 16th century due to the conflict between the Spanish invaders and the indigenous population.
The Spanish started a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous worldwide for having one of the best polo teams and players in the whole world.
The biggest championship will be held this year in December in the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Step aside, you can bet on the smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
If you want to know news about championships and where to buy polo match tickets, go check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, on the other side of FIC West store.
You can use pounds sterling everywhere on the island, and also Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted many times.
In remote islands, they might not accept credit cards, although they might accept British and American currency. Make sure to check with the owners from the beginning to know the accepted payment methods.
It's impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you have to exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located in the southern part of the Equator, there will be summer when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions, and the temperature often exceeds 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
The winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
The amount of rain stays consistent throughout the year, without distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Even though many of the animals in the garden are used to seeing people, wild animals are wild in the end, and you can't feed them or bother them.
According to the Garden Authority, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how obvious it seems that you can easily attract [wild animals], it's possible that bison, antelopes, gazelles, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are big and wild, and can also be dangerous, so you need to give them space.
Move aside, be careful because the smells attract bears and other wild animals. So don't store or cook food with a strong smell, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Apolo and has a population of less than 40,000 people.
It was founded in the fifties and was the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the location of naval clashes whose reputation was bad in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain were refused permission to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British warship. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Maoist movement's struggle for independence, the peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of Chief Tupou Tamasesi Lilوفي III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbors, there are many beaches, and the most famous ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by botokwa trees.
Tamaki Beaches Road is located in Viaduct Harbour, near Mission Bay and St Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
These family beaches get crowded sometimes with a good selection of shops that line up on the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main popular beer is called "Number One". It's not a complex drink, but it's a fun and refreshing one. The other local beer is Manta.
French wine has many types, but New Zealand and Australian wines might have a wide distribution.
Tap water is safe for drinking, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.

They might hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to get other paperwork for your destination (like a visa).
Even then, any modifications or requests should be made through the travel agent initially, not directly through the hotel.
For many festivals, the vast majority of people who attend music festivals decide to camp at the site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get closer to the events, you have to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
You need to remember that the music on the main stages might be over, but there might be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.

If you're driving your car at high altitudes or over mountain passes, you need to consider the possibility of snow or ice falling or the temperatures being below zero.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak, and you won't be able to drive like you would on smooth asphalt.
During snowstorms, some ice might fall, and that's enough to block the road for a very short time.
Snowfall, icy winds, condensation, or ice on car windows can all be reasons for limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are natural in many countries, and traffic usually continues without stopping all year round.
Safari trips could be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent one due to many visitors.
The term "safari trips" is usually used to refer to travel through a country to observe the wonderful wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont becomes the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway because it regularly passes through isolated forest terrains.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, you need to be careful because there are always slopes, narrow passages, and very sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are lower than what you might notice in the previous and following sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and adhering to them is more important than anything else.
But the mobile phone service is much stronger here than the service in other parts of the road, like rural Pennsylvania.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they have many diverse benefits, like the pastries of their neighbor in the south in Austria.

If the rider fell off the horse but his leg stayed caught in the girth, the horse might run away. There are some safety precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
Initially, most of the entertainers/dancers wear horseback riding boots that have a heel and soft, narrow soles.
The second thing is some saddles, especially English saddles, which have safety bars allowing the rider to fall off the saddle as soon as you pull it back when the rider gets off.
Wadi Koshamu, and this is the first place that comes to mind when we talk about climbing in Chile, and it's known as Yosemite in South America, and it has many walls and large granite rocks.
The peaks have breathtaking views from above. Climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes between the many walls with endless possibilities.

Skiing is a major activity during travel, and there are many enthusiasts for it, and they sometimes call themselves "ski nomads," planning to spend entire vacations just for skiing in a specific place.
The idea of snowboarding is very old - cave paintings depict snowboarders dating back 5000 years BC!

The will of foreign governments to respect documents is changing significantly.
Security checkpoint searches have increasingly involved violations of privacy, especially after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
Transgender individuals before surgery need not expect to go through screenings while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Ocean currents are flows that return from the waves that break on the shore, usually near coral reefs or something like that.
Due to the terrain under the water, the returning flow from shallow areas is concentrated, and fast currents can form for the deeper water over there.
Most deaths happen because of exhaustion when you're trying to swim against the current, and that can be impossible.
As long as you swim against the current, returning won't be harder than usual.

Rowing is a national hobby in Finland, to the point that there's a boat for every seven or eight people.
He meets Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but other than that, he's unique and special (like the Netherlands, the number from one to forty).
Most distinguished Baltic tours include the perk of permanent accommodation in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historical city for several days in full and return to sleep at night on the boat.
If you only travel on coastal exploration cruises, you won't need a separate visa (starting from 2009).

Generally, there's no point in searching for cheap prices for Business Class or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines really know well that there's a specific group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money to arrive quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
