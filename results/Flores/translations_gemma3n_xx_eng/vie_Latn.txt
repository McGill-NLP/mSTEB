This not only confirms a hypothesis widely known – that at least some dinosaur species had feathers – but also provides detailed information that fossils cannot reveal, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe that this species has chestnut brown fur on top and grayish-blue or yellow/orange underneath.
This discovery also provides a deeper insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed filamentous body, they are called filamentous feathers, but they have other characteristics of feathers – fuzz and down – so researchers believe that filamentous feathers may be a later evolutionary development with these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that this plumage was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibits adult feathers rather than down.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows bird-like feathers of an adult and not the feathers of a chicken.

The work is mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations of the Centaurus galaxy.
The effect the team is seeking will be created by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in a way similar to ordinary matter.
This theory posits that most dark matter around a galaxy resides in a halo surrounding the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting has long been a low-tech affair: each voter goes to a separate polling station, casts a ballot paper printed with the names of the candidates they have chosen into an envelope.
After the staff verify the voters' identities, the voters will put the envelope into the ballot box and sign their names on the voter list.
The French electoral law is quite strict in systematizing the procedural process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are available at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except for those of valid and authorized voters.
Candidates may send a representative to observe the entire process. In the evening, ballots will be counted by volunteers under close supervision, following a special procedure.

Besides the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in 2 separate stages in the Championship.
Her first race was Slalom, where she was marked as Did Not Finish (DNF) in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors in the race had the same result.
Her other race, in the Giant Slalom skiing competition, saw her finish in 10th place in the women's rankings with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Australian athlete Claudia Loesch who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary's 9th-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers on the team did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 total Giant Slalom skiers did not place in the rankings.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Arya stated: "We have apprehended five individuals involved in the rape of the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The suspects being prosecuted are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived despite suffering severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services have freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
After that, Adekoya was convicted in Edinburgh District Court of murdering his son.
She is currently being detained pending indictment and trial, but the testimony of witnesses may be inadmissible because her image has been widely publicized.
This practice is very common in England, but Scotland is different; the laws and courts here have ruled that distributing images can be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists may be treading a dangerous path in publicizing images, etc., of suspects."
The Public Prosecution Office, which is responsible for overall prosecution, informed journalists that there would be no comment at least until the indictment.
The file, according to the leak, will mention border conflicts, something Palestine wants to base itself on based on the border before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed that were reported to include the future status of the holy city of Jerusalem with both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting the continued presence of troops in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority is only agreeing to a five-year presence.
The hunting participants in the supplementary pest control pilot program were closely monitored by forest rangers because the pilot program was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Under the cooperation agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's recruitment program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive training and guidance on safety protocols.
Martelly took the oath of office in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) comprising nine members yesterday.
This is the fifth interim electoral commission established by Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee proposed that the Provisional Election Council (CEP) previously resign. This proposal is part of a package of measures to transition to a new election for the country.
This order is Martelly's reaction to widespread protests against the regime that have been ongoing since October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from failed election organization, with some elections that should have taken place since 2011.
According to reports, approximately 60 portable music devices, specifically iPods, experienced overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says they have identified 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company claims are "not serious."
In response to the announcement, this department called the temporary postponement of Apple's report an "extremely regrettable" event.
The earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT, Friday).
The Marianas Northern Emergency Situations Management Department reports no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated there are no signs indicating a tsunami will occur.
A former Philippine police officer took a number of tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the bus they were traveling on in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Just like the Filipino photographers, the six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Later, photographers took over the space of the elderly woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He specialized in obstetrics and gynecology and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that if a certain hormone is injected, the growth rate of the fetus's lungs will be accelerated.
Xinhua reports that government investigators retrieved the two black boxes of the aircraft on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed their respect for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the First Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna is just as scary as me... maybe even scarier... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaints, his physical condition is not up to par.
He couldn't take pain medication because those drugs were banned during the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Some people have verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for Earth, along with organic material capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets have collided with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor at the beginning of this year. Last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political gossip and madness."
There were rumors that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, in contrast to ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to position aircraft with higher accuracy and providing pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation has been deployed, and ground transportation will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or shuttle parking in the area.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans of this team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University, USA and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species can evolve in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to the combination of the Darwin's finch, the Geospiza species, and the migratory Geospiza species.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be crafted into objects of very small sizes.
It can be drawn into thin strands for twisting and braiding. It can be pounded or rolled into sheets.
It can be hammered very thin and plated onto other metals. It can be hammered so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage water changes according to the acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical.
The pH is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in a chemical solution.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Knead two lumps of dry dough together, then roll them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and molding into a kind of skin.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
Remnants of wastewater systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the island of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive calls and then relay them back down, almost instantaneously.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and our observations of images.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has remarkably changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel has brought to our lives is that it has helped us travel and transport things much more easily and quickly.
It brings us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
At lower trophic levels are medium-sized cat species that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cat species (including domestic cats) prey on a large number of small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specialized job that each cat has to avoid competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cat species, living in large groups called prides.
The group consists of one to three adult males who are related to each other, along with approximately thirty females and their offspring.
Women often have close relationships with each other in a large family with many sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions operates similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, surprisingly behaving like lions (but not other large cats) in terms of behavior, and are also very dangerous to prey.
Like a decathlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a healthy human.
Tigers belong to the same group (Felidae) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cat families are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger is not like the mighty roar of a lion, but rather like a series of growls in its throat.
Ocelots are spotted cats that eat small animals. They will prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if the opportunity arises. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that South American jaguars follow scent trails and locate prey by smell, sniffing at places where prey has stood.
They can be seen very clearly in the dark with their night vision and agile movements; no one knows how. Jungle cats hunt prey by camouflaging themselves within their surroundings, then pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living organisms (a small number) breaks away from the main population (for example, when they migrate across a mountain range or a river, or to a faraway island from where they find it difficult to return), this group of organisms will often perceive that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptive abilities to become a more formidable competitor than they previously were.
The initial population didn't change at all; they still needed to adapt as before.
Over time, as the new group of residents began to adapt to the new environment, they started to look increasingly different from other resident groups.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable and extremely important consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathing out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The saltwater crocodile was an apex predator during its time, so it feared nothing, except for other saltwater crocodiles.
Its long jaw was fitted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with a set of reserve teeth in the palate, meaning nothing could escape its path.
We are not sure for certain, but it may have a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have eaten other carnivores.
It also attacks everything in the water; even gigantic dinosaurs like T. rex are no match for it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans enjoyed strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sit on stools to eat, the wealthy prefer to organize parties together and recline to eat in relaxation.
Meals in ancient Rome did not feature foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they didn't eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and never had any ancient Roman tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and considered that place to be the home of that god.
People will bring offerings to present to the gods, and the monks will strive to meet the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an outer courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary dedicated to the deity.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time living outdoors.
Women are cooking in the yard; the new shops have opened facing the street. Stones are used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the Canaan region, so wood was very expensive here.
Greenland has a sparse population. Norse mythology recounts that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and while sailing west, he discovered Greenland and named the land as such.
However, no matter what his discoveries were, the Eskimo tribes had been living there at that time.
Although all are 'Scandinavian' countries, there are still many differences in people, royalty, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the text "Declaration of Independence originally drafted on July 4, 1776." This text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one is certain about the author of the document, it is known that in the early days, the document was written on this large sheepskin (29¾ inches long and 24½ inches wide) and rolled up for preservation.
So, the ability to add annotations is likely just a simple highlighting label.
The Allied landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
This area was ruled by the French "Vichy" government. These were the French who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces launched "Operation Dragoon," invading southern France.
Within just two weeks, U.S. and Free French military forces liberated Southern France and then shifted their focus to Germany.
Civilization is a prominent culture shared by a large group of people who live and work collectively, forming a society.
The term "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning belonging to the people, related to "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or state. It also partially defines the scale of society.
The state of the city is the predecessor of nations. The culture of this civilization contains the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a remaining and well-preserved cultural mark.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving credible historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially established a loose central government – consisting only of the Congress – based on the Articles of Confederation.
The National Assembly has no power to impose taxes, and since there is no national executive or judiciary, they must rely on the authority of the state governments, which often refuse to cooperate, to enforce any decisions.
It also has no authority to amend customs laws or tariffs between states.
The charter requires unanimous agreement from all states before any amendments can be made, and the states disregard the central government to the point where state representatives frequently do not attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer (football), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern region, with Italians competing in international arenas and the Olympic Games.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu Island), Japan becomes the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster of islands, Japan is also often referred to as a "chain of islands" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors traveling by ship recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to change the local people's grain farming practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice paddies and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki,ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been restored to help visitors better visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, the film size that was popular before the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format) correspond to or closely approximate this frame rate.
The rule of thirds is often mocked and misused, but it's a simple guideline for creating dynamism while still being used as a measure of order in an image.
According to this rule, the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
Throughout this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now wealthy and powerful, began to come under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has been the binding thread between European nations, despite lingering differences in language and custom.
Its absolute power affected everyone, from royalty to commoners.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church contributions exist for that purpose.
The central authorities of the church have been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many people to question whether the doctrines preached are actually followed.
After the war broke out, the British immediately blockaded the German navy.
This strategy has proven effective by severing military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade violates widely accepted international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
He deployed naval mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, posing a danger to even neutral vessels.
There hasn't been much reaction to this tactic. Therefore, Germany also expects to receive a similar reaction to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing view among most citizens and nations leaned towards pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of World War I, all nations wished to avoid a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He came to America with only four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different eras; each period of Chinese history or each powerful family corresponded to a different dynasty.
Furthermore, between dynasties were periods of instability when the regions were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars erupted amidst numerous conflicts between nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying just to compete for a seat on the throne in the grand hall of the capital city of Chang'an.
There have been many political and social impacts, such as the use of statistical systems, the transition from an autocratic monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to any single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, all professions opened up to men seeking employment, helping the most ambitious individuals achieve success.
This also applies to the military, as military rank is based on qualities rather than position.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed members of the working class in various other countries, urging them to rise up in rebellion.
Muhammad was deeply concerned with matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on Mount Noor (of light) to meditate.
Enduring over time, the Hira Cave preserves vivid images of the spiritual trends left by the Prophet Muhammad.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find, even when people know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There was nothing but the vast, crystalline sky perfectly embracing the mountain ranges. A small world, known and spoken of from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt, features numerous pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, the largest), many smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor his wives and family members.
The "hook" mark looks like a V, and the "stroke down" mark looks like a pushpin or a square missing its bottom side.
Going up means you should start from the big end of the handle and push it upwards, and going down means you should start from the grip part (where your hand holds the handle) and pull it downwards.
Moving up on the bowstring usually creates a softer sound, while moving down creates a more powerful and decisive sound.
Feel free to mark up the score, but remember that the printed accidentals have musical meaning, so please respect them.
On October 6, 1789, while at the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and his sister – Madam Elizabeth – were forced by a crowd of women vendors from the market to return to Paris in terror.
On the horse-drawn carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage window.
A person in the crowd waved the head of a slain royal guard from the Palace of Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the cost of the United States' imperialist war of conquest in the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of the expenses and interest on floating bonds issued under the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the super-profits obtained from the exploitation of the Filipino people for a long time have become the main source of revenue for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to their founding.
The period in which these events took place is typically called the High Middle Ages, a stage in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Central Middle Ages period occurred after the Early Middle Ages period and before the Late Middle Ages period, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technical determinism is an overarching concept encompassing many ideas in practice, ranging from driving technological progress or forcing it, to the narrow meaning that human destiny is controlled by an implicit logic system linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism have two common ideas: technological development follows its own trajectory, independent of cultural and political influences, and technology has an "impact" on existing societies, rather than conditioned societies.
For example, one could say that cars running on engines inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for some cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The excessive number of car owners also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, leading to the invention of new medical technologies to recover from bodily injuries.
Romanticism has a significant cultural determining factor, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped each individual, and over time, customs and culture related to that area developed, and these, combined with social standing, were preferable to dictatorial laws imposed from above.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal period.
It was renowned as a focal point of luxury, starting around 400 BC and lasting until approximately 1100 AD.
The city's status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders exchanged the valuable gifts they brought, such as silk and spices, for goods that the Byzantine market offered at a higher price.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the middle of the period from the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style in the West may be lagging by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. A result of the Crusades brought one of the most important developments at that time: people started using buttons.
Sustainable agriculture is a form of agriculture practiced solely to meet the basic food needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, typically involving only organic fertilization, using stored seeds of native varieties combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Throughout history, most farmers have practiced self-sufficient agriculture, a practice that continues in many developing countries.
Group culture gathers individuals with similar ideologies who feel ostracized by social norms, helping them gain a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of their members.
The factors determining the differences in regional cultures can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express their relationships through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles such as fashion, way of speaking, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite a few unfortunate cases of children involving neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse and lack of social interaction from caregivers when the children grow up.
Children like that are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been kept captive (often by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children is due to parents rejecting children with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Street children may have been cruelly abused or traumatized before being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to be raised by animals; others are believed to have to live alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more engaging, the Scaffolding method takes it a step further.
Making a model is not a learning method, but a means of assistance for those experiencing a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Lesson plans can be in a physical or virtual format; in other words, the teacher is a form of lesson plan, but as a small virtual assistant within Microsoft Office.
The virtual Scaffolds method is internalized within the software and aims to pose questions, provide reminders, and explain processes that may challenge students to solve problems independently.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse or even exploitation.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurtured, cared for, and educated, as many are currently experiencing.
We have found the Care and Nutrition System to be a safe place for these children.
Our care and nurturing system needs to provide a safe home, dedicated caregivers, a stable educational environment, and reliable medical care.
A home is considered a place that provides the essentials that your previous home didn't.
The Internet combines elements of both community communication and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to new aspects of how we use it and how we achieve satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been proposed as important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Level of self-engagement" and "continuous correlation" are also considered new driving forces according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they conducted a survey of readers' reactions to electronic web pages.
The use of video cameras has led to important discoveries in interpreting fleeting expressions, specifically those movements that occur in just a few milliseconds of the face.
Specifically, it is believed that someone can detect when someone is lying by accurately interpreting even the smallest expressions.
In his article "The President's Address," Oliver Sacks points out how people who are unable to understand the speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even believes that these capabilities in interpreting human behavior might also exist in other animal species, for example, domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
The insertion mutation generates a new genetic variant and selection eliminates it from the pool of expressed variants.
The separation and recombination occur back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the desert, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy the demand for essential amino acids from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant-based protein sources would likely be found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal products (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a rich amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After carefully considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep intervention is the process of intentionally waking a person during their normal sleep time and allowing them to sleep again for a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a nearly silent alarm clock to help you wake up without fully waking up.
If you find yourself repeatedly setting your alarm while sleeping, you can place the clock in a different corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (specifically water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bed, which will cause you to wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress the body and mind have to endure.
As tension decreases, positive energy becomes more apparent. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on this path is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is expanded by the path of compassion of Mahayana Buddhism and many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of encompassing love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is cultivated.
Germany was once a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. By the end of World War II, conflict over systems, procedures, and culture caused these countries to become divided again.
In the two years following the war's conclusion, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought with real battles by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian sector.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops advanced and established the Belarus and Ukraine fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using boats and ships to transport goods is the most effective way at the present time to transport a large number of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional mission of the navy is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's capability to transport people and goods, and at the same time, to interfere with the movement of people and goods of the enemy forces.
One of the most notable examples recently is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The United States attempted to ferry supplies and war materials along the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy also used U-boats to try to stop this supply route.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain after having subdued the rest of Europe.
Domesticated goats first appeared around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats are often raised in herds, foraging freely on hillsides or other grazing areas, primarily herded by children or adolescents, similar to sheep herding. These herd-based livestock farming methods are still used to this day.
The roads for horse-drawn carriages were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the horse trails only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull with greater speed and carry heavier loads compared to traveling on the rough roads of everyday life.
Tie rods were known fairly early on to hold the rails in place. However, people gradually realized these rails would work more effectively with a small metal shim at the front.
This has become commonplace; however, iron has caused horse-drawn cart wheels to wear out faster.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was launched.
The first form of transportation known is walking. Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright humans).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus apes, did not walk upright.
The characteristics of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more harmoniously with the environment, we can participate in environmental movements, and we can even become environmental activists to alleviate the burden on the future to some extent.
This is also like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and figure out how to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed too much thanks to human achievements in science and technology, and problems have also become more severe due to overpopulation coupled with humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After being approved by the National Assembly on July 4th, the handwritten manuscript signed by Speaker John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Print."
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy was sent to London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap sheets are believed to be the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy is no longer available.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think this animal is a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many similarities to dinosaurs.
Their feet are scaly with claws. They lay eggs and walk on two back legs like T-Rexes.
Almost all the computers we are using today are based on the conversion of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only represent one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits—or "bits"—used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious symptoms immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are often not enough to immediately base a diagnosis on.
The clearest sign of organ poisoning is likely the presence of an open container of poisonous medication or household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bọ" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, an insect with a high adaptability to parasitize humans.
Both blood-sucking insects and bed bugs are species that leave the nest late and are adapted to living in nests or on hosts.
Across the United States, there are currently approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This number has made MS the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples have decided to plan to adopt.
In an adoption agreement, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world operates through scientific methods. This approach has actually guided most scientific research.
However, experimentation and empirical testing are not the only experiments used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. They pose questions and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Acceptance is Aristotle's viewpoint on all matters related to science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West realized it had been cut off from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many rhythms observed in psychology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and the generation of these rhythms through the biological clock.
The cyclical rhythm, not simply a response to external cyclical signals, has been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillation that will continue to run its cycle freely even in the absence of external influences.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the most convincing pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label the DNA strand inside the bacteriophage with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutations can cause a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene segment affected, and whether the affected cell is a stem cell or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts tourists who enjoy exploring natural areas to immerse themselves in the scenery, plants, and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and researching information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking pictures of, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small towns to go to work, passing by others who are heading to the very place they just left to work.
In a space shuttle transportation system, everyone is connected with and supports a separate automobile transportation system.
Today, science posits that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that has aided human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause complaints, and why do they frequently make mistakes? Is it that transportation engineers are not qualified enough? Or is there a more fundamental reason at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic flow because it's impossible to predict drivers' behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within appropriate ranges; therefore, traffic flows tend to be consistent in a reasonable way and can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better simulate traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
Thanks to this, they can hide in small places to escape predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people think he was right, but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and second longest in the world. It carries eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
20% of the water flowing from the rivers on this planet into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramid complex has never been surpassed in size and perfect construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the works of their ancestors that still stand after a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the fewest citizens.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is used as a daily language by people working in the region, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these elements could be found in nature in their native form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the hypothesis that all things are created from a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he proposed that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could be as large as a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, from its very inception, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerge, pencils gradually lose their place and are increasingly used less.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, never having to sharpen pencils again.
People can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer emerges.
A nuclear fission reactor operates based on the principle of using energy to combine atomic nuclei with multiple protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck uphill. The body splits once again, and then releases a portion of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no energy input.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 kilometers on the left side and about 100 kilometers on the hidden surface of the Moon.
It is thinner under the maria (seas) and thicker in the highlands.
There may be multiple influence valleys on the adjacent slope because the thinner veneer layer allows magma to rise more easily to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what captures people's attention or attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans acquire certain needs and/or desires from the external environment as they mature.
These theories examine what drives some people to achieve their goals and what environmental factors influence their actions or inactions.
Two common theoretical frameworks are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two approaches that can arise when a manager begins leading former colleagues. The first approach is to try to maintain close relationships.
This style of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and maintaining accountability among team members.
Someone will transform into a completely different person and feel compelled to change everything the whole group is doing and implement it themselves.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This action can sometimes lead to cracks in the relationship between leaders and other members of the team.
Remote teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still some minor differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as the primary point of contact for members of the physical team, keeping them closely connected.
They often have more self-management than regular members because their team can meet on different schedules, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of the "invisible team" is also a special component of the virtual team (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"Invisible group" is a management group where each member will report. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why does an organization have to go through a time-consuming process to establish an educational organization? One goal of implementing structured learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are utilized effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
Therefore, the process of collaborating to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of improvement to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership needs to foster a culture of innovation and share knowledge and exploration among the entire team.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuous approach is a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and supportive behavior is of interest to scientists in their research.
For a long time, we have known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some neurological functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has great significance in the science fiction industry, it also shapes a very important branch in computer science, dealing with behaviors, having the ability to learn and be sensitive, and simulating intelligence in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, diagnostic and customer query response capabilities, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Those things have become their own rules, focusing on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
Today, AI (artificial intelligence) systems are commonly used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as in many home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of the class. The teacher frequently takes students to places where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology is delivering solutions through virtual reality experiences. Students can view museum artifacts, tour aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in class.
Sharing the picnic trip online is also a wonderful way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year students at Bennet College in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital. Each year, this website is redesigned, however, the old versions are still kept online as a souvenir.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. When these students start blogging, they often make grammatical and spelling mistakes due to carelessness, but the presence of readers generally changes that.
Students are often the harshest critics, so the blogger started trying to improve the quality of their posts to avoid criticism.
Simultaneously, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to become smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom setting.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more adept at analytical and reasoning skills; through positive responses to online materials, students can identify their role in the context of others' writing as well as present their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's historical and modern artifacts.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka, boasting pristine natural beauty and more.
All of this, and that, highlights what outsiders perceive as the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north have a sparse population, and some regions are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that might surprise many people: African Americans living in the U.S. outnumber Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest region and is a continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are not independent nations, or are linked to France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This area borders Sahei to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female tourists should say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be effective (only those that don't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to situations they perceive as harassment, and actions like following someone or holding their arm are very normal.
Be firm when you refuse, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences – that doesn't make wrong right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and it was only abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt this city in the style of Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina of Medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan goods for sale, such as Tagine pots, ceramics, leather goods, shisha, and all sorts of trinkets, but these are mostly aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was leveled by the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcanic eruption disaster buried most of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is still within acceptable safety limits, all visits from outside the city still need to be carefully researched to understand the current fighting situation in North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking equipment in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to explore Goma. The usual price (locally) for that short trip is around 500 Congolese Francs.
Due to its relatively inaccessible nature, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for remote and exotic lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its fame attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to desert encroachment.
That is one of the main stops in the special television program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
This city stands in complete contrast to other cities in the country because it has a much stronger Arab influence than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each being the habitat of a different wildlife ecosystem.
This is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship property of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, conservation activities take place daily and there is an entrance fee to enter the park.
It can also be beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, as it may allow you access to parks in South Africa or all National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong refers to the territory of Hong Kong, and it is a place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
The row of skyscrapers makes Hong Kong's skyline resemble a sparkling bar graph, clarified by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To view Hong Kong from its most beautiful angle, leave the island and head straight to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong's urban areas have been developed in concentrated areas along reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonizers seized as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a very good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Not only do these forests include mangrove wetlands, but they also encompass some remaining areas of the majestic forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses departing from the inter-district bus station (along the river) run all day, although primarily, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, will depart from 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM.
Because inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japan's small Coaster buses, which are very comfortable and durable.
Riding in a shared taxi is a convenient and fast way to travel to nearby locations like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque city in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers, 83 meters high, 378 meters long, with two lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge's clear height is at least 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to officially open in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs stations are completed, as planned.
The Guaraní are the largest indigenous people living in the area that is now the eastern region of Paraguay, with a semi-nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle and subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to various indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," came into being following the clash between the conquering Spanish and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish initiated a three-century-long colonial period.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has strived to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the horse racing track in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also take place here at other times of the year.
To get information about the tournament and where to buy tickets to watch polo, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which has the same value as the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street, opposite FIC West.
Generally, the British pound is accepted anywhere in the archipelago, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British or US currency might be; please check with the host beforehand to confirm accepted payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland dollars outside of the Falkland Islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, the temperature is usually above +30°C.
Winter can be cold in a misleading way: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combined create a sensation of cold that's more intense than what the thermometer shows.
There isn't a distinct rainy or dry season: rainfall throughout the year is almost constant.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife are still wild animals and should not be fed or teased.
According to park authorities, please maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, wild boars, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large mammals can attack people.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them their space.
Additionally, be mindful of smells that may attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous food and maintain cleanliness around the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval blockade in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for a British battleship. Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the period of conflict for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) on the Pacific stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly safe sandy beaches for swimming and mostly have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can sometimes be crowded, with many shops lining the coast. It's a safe place to swim.
Local beer is mainly 'Number One', which isn't a mixed beer, but it's refreshing and crisp. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many types of French wine you need to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected when transported.
Tap water in the area is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also readily available if you're concerned about that.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is espresso coffee cappuccino with a layer of cream on top (not foamed), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate according to Belgian standards. Expensive but excellent fruit juice.
There are many tours to this coral reef year-round, and injuries caused by it are rare.
However, please follow the government's recommendations, comply with all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the 1770 area. They can occasionally be found outside of this time.
Sharks do appear, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not typically live in the sea; their primary ecosystem is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps travelers feel reassured that they will have a place to stay upon arrival.
Travel companies often partner with specific hotels, although you can book alternative accommodations like campsites through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combine flights and hotels.
They can also hold a spot for you if you need time to consider the job offer or process other documents related to your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any request or adjustment required must not be sent directly to the hotel but must first be handled through the travel agency.
For some festivals, the large number of attendees decides to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity area, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the sound system.
Please remember that even though the music on the main stage has stopped, there will still be some areas of the festival continuing to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check your sleeping cabin, because when icebreakers operate, they create terrible noises that not everyone can tolerate.
The travel time of the Saint Petersburg train includes time spent within the city. Passengers on the train are visa-exempt (subject to terms and conditions).
Casinos often try to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. These places often lack windows and clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They often provide special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers comfortable and to encourage them to stay.
Some venues serve alcoholic beverages on-site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers understand the importance of staying clear-headed.
Anyone wanting to drive in mountainous areas or cross mountain passes should assess the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The low friction on the icy and snow-covered road makes it impossible to drive as you would on a normal paved road.
If there's a blizzard, even a short period of snowfall can be enough to trap you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow, blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal phenomena in many countries, and traffic is almost never disrupted year-round.
Safari is likely the most attractive destination in Africa and a highlight for many tourists.
The term safari is widely used to describe overland travel for wildlife viewing in Africa, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles, and with ordinary tools, we can easily observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be very shy, so to see them more clearly, you should use binoculars.
A safari hiking trip (also known as "forest entertainment hiking," "adventure trekking," or "phượt") involves hiking and climbing mountains for several hours or days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before any cancellation announcements, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary. However, as of the end of March, most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus did not allow extensions until July 2020 – the time of the planned Olympic Games.
Most event tickets are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
The fact that wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board for guests to borrow, even if you don't see one in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't like wearing tights, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it may cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, may cause a fire).
There are many ways to filter water, among which some are very effective for removing specific risks.
In some places, boiling water for just one minute is enough, while in others it needs to boil for a few minutes.
The effectiveness of different filters varies, so if you're concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Tourists may encounter harmful animals they have never seen in their home country.
Harmful organisms can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Inherent infectious diseases, or dangerous animals, which can cause injury or death through force, are typically not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from value-added tax and consumption tax at certain locations.
Tourists visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The long distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions on Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing desolate, forested areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you should prepare yourself for steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit in this area is significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – the typical speed is around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to these regulations is extremely important.

A horse's stirrup is a tool that helps riders swing from the saddle to their feet.
They offer greater stability for the driver but may raise safety concerns due to the potential to trap the driver's feet.
If a rider falls off a horse but gets their leg stuck in the saddle, they could be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, several preventative measures can be taken.
First, most horse riders wear high-heeled boots with smooth, quite narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the billets to release from the saddle if the rider is pulled backward upon falling.

It's related, but usually doesn't include freestyle or alpine skiing; the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much more specialized skis and boots.
Think of a ski trip as being similar to a hiking trip.
Under favorable conditions, you will cover a longer distance than walking – but it's very rare that you'll achieve the speed of cross-country skiing when not carrying a heavy pack on your back and skiing on a flat surface.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Typically, traveling through multiple countries means applying for visas and having your passport stamped many times.
However, in this aspect, the Schengen area operates almost as a single country.

Similarly, by possessing a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no specific definition to determine whether a manufactured item is antique or not. Some tax authorities regulate goods over 100 years old as antiques.

Transgender individuals before surgery should not think they can go through scanners without affecting their privacy and self-esteem.
A whirlpool is a current of water that flows backward from waves crashing onto the beach, typically found in reefs or similar areas.
Due to the underwater terrain, backflow concentrates in some deeper areas, and fast currents flowing into deeper waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which seems like an impossible feat.
Immediately after you escape the whirlpool, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try swimming towards a direction where you won't be swept away by the current, or choose to stay put and wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether anyone has noticed your dangerous situation.
