USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress through significant change within our organization, rather than by removing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse described with such courage by those who spoke out against Larry Nassar went undetected for so long, and will embrace any necessary and appropriate change.

This doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely established, but it provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the fur of this animal was cinnamon-colored brown on the top and the bottom is clear or carotenoid-colored.
The database also provides information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur ribs do not have a well-developed spine, called a rachis, but they have other characteristics of ribs – "barbs" and "barbules" – researchers deduced that the rachis was most likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The structure of the quill suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows quill of an adult and not the thin and soft quills of a juvenile.
Researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur at this age, the sample shows adult scales and not a fluff pile.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: all stellar activity in the system has been found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reconnection.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for was caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Triangulum Galaxy.
Just as the moon has a pull on the earth and causes tides, so too does the Road of Saint Anne exert force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a type of diadem and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovers Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to its very high fatality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the bug at the hospital, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting traditionally was a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except for those of registered and authorized voters as appropriate.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strong supervision, according to specific procedures.

Those who died were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla ended up with injuries to his arm and cheek, while Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon didn't work while it was pointed at the five-man's head. Schneider has continuous pain, is blind in one eye, missing part of his skull and has a rebuilt face made of titanium.
Schneider testified via a video link from a USAF base in his birthplace.
As a result of the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual heats in the Championships.
Her first one was Slalom, where she achieved a "Did Not Finish" in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result on that hill.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the seated group were unable to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not finish in the rankings.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss and Ukrainian woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of murdering her son.
She is under detention until she is accused and prosecuted, but any testimony from eyewitnesses may be influenced because her photograph was widely published.
This is a common practice in other countries in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts consider the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists appear to be putting themselves in danger if they publish pictures etc. of suspected people."
The Office of the Crown, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comments at least until the accusation.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the claim regarding the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered subjects reported include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
Tire tests for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the tests were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association’s Sports Shooting for Recreational Purposes program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Direct Conservation Agent of Parks and Heritage at the NPWS, the four selected snipers for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli appointed a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last year, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to guide the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were once violent, were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were held in 2011.
Around 60 cases of damaged iPods due to overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it had been informed of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had been informed of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry replied by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Marianas Trench Emergency Management Office stated that there were no reported damages nationwide.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A Filipino woman, formerly a police officer, held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed with firearms.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He was trained as a chemist and started working at the Auckland Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature payments during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it alleviates the maturation of the fetal lungs of the unborn child.
Xinhua reported that on Tuesday, government investigators found two "black boxes" which are the flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also gave a gift to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two full moons. Truly unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna wasn't like the others...perhaps even more than them...I love her and miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
From 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this view and wish for Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the voting, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but due to his complaints, there were doubts about his health condition.
He cannot take the necessary medication for his pain because they are prohibited by Gambling.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Missouri Central, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software until the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are striving to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets have impacted Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began governing earlier this year and signed a draft law last month that would ban same-sex marriage.
He refers to the discourse as "words and political stupidity."
It was speculated that he would present a candidacy for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, in contrast to old ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide navigators with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being provided, and the above-ground railways will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and "park-and-ride" facilities are not available on site.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the possibility arose that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" provided a report on the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to the hybridization between the endemic Darwin's barnacles, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus barnacle, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be rolled and hammered. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and rolled onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating illuminated handwritten books.
This is called the pH of chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The pH of the litmus paper changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry towels together and then, with wet hands, clean them and put them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, causing it to feel strange and form a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets also in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia, and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
Giant rockets longer than 100 feet are needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in unimaginable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us easier and faster transportation.
He took the railway, the carriage, and many other means of transport with him.
Below, there are more medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat a small prey population much larger than insects, rodents, slugs, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and that prevents it from competing with others.
Millions are the most social species, and they live in large groups that are called "prides" in English.
Groups ("prides") are made up of one to three related adult males, along with a maximum of thirty females and juveniles.
Women are generally closely related to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
The June groups act like wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and they are also very deadly in their grip.
A great athlete in everything, the tiger can pounce (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times stronger than the strength of a healthy human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar powerfully.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a clumsy, guttural sentence of words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch rodents, lizards, small mammals, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision, and they also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is dispersed from the main population from which they originated (as if they were migrating across a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island so they could not easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it gradually becomes less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., release through breathing).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide oxygen.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Her long beard was filled with more than 70 years of many journeys, as well as another set of years etched on her mouth, which meant that anyone who crossed her path had no chance of escape.
I'm not certain, but it's possible he had a split tongue. His diet included rodents, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
He attacks everything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't defeat him.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a type of rodent resembling a dormouse that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the gentlemen enjoyed having lunch together where they would lean on their sides while eating.
The diet of Ancient Rome could not include the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have wheat, barley, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever drank from this well.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered the home of the god.
People used to make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an entrance in the temple and, behind it, a sanctuary inside that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Once upon a time, special towers were built in the complex of pyramids, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home wasn't so important.
The majority of Jewish family life took place abroad.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were simply an open counter facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests on the land of Kangħan, therefore timber was expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the sagas of Norway it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Mom, with all due respect to the discovery that was made, the Inuit tribes were already living there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, rulers, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not from him. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence was the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While it is unknown who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large document made of parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored away.
So, it's likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The landing of D-Day and the battles that followed liberated Northern France, but Southern France remained not free.
He was led by the French "Vichy" regime. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civility is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and which in a certain way also defines the size of society.
The cities that have existed are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from different generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and a just dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—where the Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or national judiciary, it depended on the state authorities to enforce all its acts, but often these did not cooperate.
He had no strength to overcome the tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government seriously to the point that their representatives were often absent.
Italian national football, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often called, from a geographical standpoint, an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan dates back to the beginning of the 15th century when European sailors passing by there recorded the name of the island as Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in northern Taiwan and began a transformation in the production practices of indigenous wheat and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the loss in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which regulated the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Large parts of the buildings at the tip of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its aspect ratio is determined by the imaging sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the most simple whole number proportion) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, a family of APS formats) have this aspect ratio, or are very similar to it.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
This declares that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and influential, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone, and the sultanate became common property.
One of the main Christian principles is that good should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the hostilities broke out, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective by halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, thereby causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevalent attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the terrible events and atrocities of World War I, nations longed to avoid a situation like this recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with $4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time; each stage of China and each family that held power were distinct dynasties.
Also between each dynasty there was a time of instability with the provinces divided. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years between the House of Han and that of Jin.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died fighting to seize the highest seat in the magnificent palace within Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, and this allowed those who were the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, army ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He would frequently visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has remained in existence over time, clearly shows Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains in the Montes Arabes of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to find, even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing but a clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures that were built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "the Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinxes.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts, and temples were built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The "upstroke" mark appears as a V shape and the "downstroke" mark appears as a steeple or a square shape without a bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and pull the bow, and down means you should start at the grip (the place where your hands are holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Playing a stringed instrument upwards generates a softer sound, while playing downwards is louder and more assertive.
You can make the marks you want with pencils, but remember that bowing marks are there for musical reasons and therefore, they should normally be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced, on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a violent crowd of women from the market.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd cheered for the King and Queen, holding the windows of their carriage open.
At one point, a member of the crowd gestured towards the royal guard who was killed inside Versailles before the Queen who was mourning.
The consequences of the United States' imperial war in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the majority of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the fundamental gains of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which these events took place was commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is driven by a underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a largely predetermined course beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, for its part, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
Nevertheless, the road network throughout the country is not economically viable for just a few cars, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increase in the mass of cars also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and culture related to that geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the society's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world in contemporary times, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
His status deteriorated throughout the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusades returned carrying goods such as silk and spices that were more valued than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
During this period, the transfer of the Fashion Capital title took place from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Firstly, clothing had a great influence from the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow pace of communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages in Western Europe, it began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds that are native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques in order to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals who share similar views and who feel forgotten by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often indicate their affiliation through the use of distinct and symbolic styles, which include mannerisms, customs, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' refusal to accept a serious intellectual or physical disability in the children.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised completely by non-human animals, wild offspring exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the particular animal that raised them, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather support provided to individuals going through a new learning experience such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but even the little paper clip character in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is embedded in the software and aims to query, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to manage independently.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons involving neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but this still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caregivers who offer their love, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which she was taken.
The internet connects elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach and satisfactions of use.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, fleeting facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document "The President's Speech," indicates that people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage are, nonetheless, able to evaluate sincerity with great precision.
He even suggests that skills like these in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation here and there between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, the lack of doing this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant resources were accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast to this, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only difficult to digest, but also provides a high quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
When we consider everything, we can't imagine that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost in the same way that chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then sleeping for a short time afterward (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using relatively subtle disclosures that bring you into awareness without completely overwhelming you.
If you find yourself resetting your clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, and this will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, in order to encourage the person to get up and pass urine.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the body and spirit of the person.
The lower your stress levels, the more positive the life force present will be. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded by the compassion of Mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the idea that love accepts everything.
Through the practice of Kundalini Yoga (awakened energy), the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies the Yoga of the Goddesses. Through visualizing various goddesses, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was still a common factor in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the lack of agreement on the system, process, and culture led to the countries fighting.
Barely two years after the end of the war, those who were formerly allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She had 40 years of smoke ahead of her, and she had to be fiercely fought, by alternative armed groups, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already divided, and the only unit was able to fire and reorganize itself anew along the Vistula River.
However, these plans became obsolete almost immediately when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and objects to traverse the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of navies was to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies fallen, Germany would likely have been able to defeat Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that sheep were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they would have an easy way to acquire milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated animals were generally kept in enclosures that sheltered from the winds or other areas of shade, and often they were tended by animal herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These shade enclosure methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways simply consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the boats that pulled them to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads than on the roads at that time.
The "cross ties" (crossed sleepers) were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on the top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron causes more damage to the wooden wheels of the handcarts.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron railways were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus appeared (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright habitually.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as far back as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more in favor of the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. Despite this, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems and disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to the excess population and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Following its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a short distance to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, ordering that it be read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and pointed beaks, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals at home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted as parasites of humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are incredible, adapted to live in a home or at their host's location.
Around the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their children, to raise a child.
This couple can choose to make an adoption plan for raising their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquished their parental rights so that another couple could become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method in fact guides much of scientific research.
However, she is not alone; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, which become questions, and observations become guidance as well for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including psychology, were accepted.
When the knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in the vast majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perpetuate a free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main clues that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages to introduce their own DNA into the bacterium.
They carried out two experiments by labeling either the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive copper.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected portion of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are microbial line cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells of microbes can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to the park and the information center about the ecosystem.
An example of this is that you visit, take pictures, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of the country by car to go to work and pass by other people whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is, in some way, linked to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, it's rare to hear similar levels of concern about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems create problems like these, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two locations and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to keep themselves within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically from one moment to the next.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot turn back their wings are the mayfly and the azure damselfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought they were right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
He seems sensitive, because the world doesn't feel like it's moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in some places it has a width of six miles.
In total, 20 percent of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and the finest in their construction technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were many more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by many who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, because all of these can be discovered in nature in their native form and it is relatively simple to dig for them in mines using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, put forward the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorizes that they change into new substances to form what we see.
The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You might also have a bond that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the typewriter was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and became less and less used.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never need to go to the press.
Who knows what will happen to the keyboard when something newer is connected?
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is released when a nucleus combines with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to when you push a heavy cart uphill, the nucleus splitting then releases a little of that energy.
Which atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to split with very little or no effort?
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is wide about 70 km on the near side and 100 km wide on the far side.
It is thinner under the "Maria" and thicker under the "highlands."
There might be more moon landings on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized when they matured into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and which things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can result when managers start managing those who were formerly their partners. One end of the spectrum is that they try to remain feeling like one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary action, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and ensure people are accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change every aspect of the team and claim it as their own.
After all, the boss is finally responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often, they have more autonomy than members of a conventional team because their teams can meet according to time zones that vary, and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of an "invisible team" is also a unique component of a virtual team (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization need to go through the lengthy process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of putting learning organization concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, a collaborative work process of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared understanding and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating consciousness. Therefore, this makes the field of research less broad and considerably more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
For a long time it was known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to provide responses to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Things like these have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into various computer software applications in homes and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often, teachers like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours on location. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual journey with no one is also a very good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; every year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although many students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they generally have an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts working to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also helps students learn more about the world around them. The need to satisfy their audience's interest inspires students to be more accessible and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the enchanting and bilingual capital city of Canada, and it features a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further north are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond it.
All of these matters and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger valleys further north have a rather sparse population, and some are valleys in a nearly uninhabited natural state.
For comparison of the population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent when we talk about wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts on beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European and colonial influence began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the coast, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who is traveling states that she is married, and what her current marital status is.
He was told to wear a sweatshirt too (but not one that looks like it costs a lot of money).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as an annoyance, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, abducted by force, etc.
Stay strong when you reject a man, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber shepherds in the 10th century AD, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan restored the city as Dar al-Bayda and it was named "Casablanca" by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, cookware, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of souvenirs, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which destroyed most of the city's roads, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched to be aware of the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base to go for a tour to the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Gorilla trekking in the Virunga Mountains in Africa.
You can use a bodaboda (taxi motor) to drive around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Together with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main segments during the PBS special series "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city strongly contrasts with the other cities in the country, because it has more Maltese elements than African ones.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the west, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like in all the National Parks of South Africa, daily measures for conservation and park entry are applied.
It might also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selections of parks in South America or to all National Parks of South America.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The silhouette of the buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong was reflected in a paper bar with shimmering light due to its appearance with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to Kowloon's waterfront on the other side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interiors of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest portion in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in coastal areas – they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 wild dogs with stripes in the area.
The line buses depart from the bus station between districts (river long) during the day, although many of them, especially those going towards the East and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Because the buses between districts are often very full, it is recommended that you buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts have small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, are 378 meters long, and have two wide decks of 3.50 m.
The vertical void under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who continued to live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Indian Province," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its foundation in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller games can also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley, next to the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although it may be that the British pound and US dollars are accepted; speak to the owners beforehand to see what method of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located in the Southern Hemisphere of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be eerily cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't specific seasons of "rain" and "dryness": the amount of rain stays the same throughout the year.
Although many domesticated animals in the park see humans, wild animals should remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose (large deer of North America), bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are bitten because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their space.
However, you should know that strong winds attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or storing food with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the place where the infamous naval conflict of 1889 took place, where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most well-known ones are located in three zones.
The bays of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
They are almost all nests made of sand with secure mooring, and the majority have the hollow provided by the pohutukawa tree.
The apartments on Tamaki Drive are located within the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
These are sandy beaches for families that are often crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French white wines you can find, but the white wines of New Zealand and Australia probably travel better.
The local tap water is good for drinking, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee called "flat white" is not familiar. "Short black" is "espresso", cappuccino comes filled with lots of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is very expensive but excellent.
Many journeys to the bank happen throughout the year, and the flows due to one of these causes on the bank are rare.
Look, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay very close attention to the safety messages.
The box jellyfish is found near bays and near river estuaries from October to April in the northern part of 1770. One can often see them also outside of these times.
Although manatees exist, they rarely attack people. Many manatees are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Freshwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers in the Northern Territory, north of Rockhampton.
If he/she books in advance, the traveler can rest assured that they will have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, although you can find it possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even packages that combine flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any amendment or request, however, must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For many festivals, the majority of those who attend music festivals decide to camp on site, and many of them consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you need to arrive early to have a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages might end, there might still be festival sections playing music late into the night.
Which festivals have special camping areas for families with young children?
If you are going to cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, carefully check the cabin location, because when passing through the ice, a terrible noise is produced for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are generally no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
Generally, they tend to have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Which places offer free alcoholic beverages? However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering fog, snow, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with gravel and potholes, there isn't much grip and you can't drive as if you were on exposed asphalt.
During strong thunderstorms, a sufficient amount of hail can fall in a short time to cause damage.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling fog or snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and slushy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow mostly without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a major highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to traveling on land for the observation of wild and wonderful African animals, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come towards cars and are near standard equipment that allows for good views.
Millions, cities, and leopards are dwindling, and you see them better with binoculars.

The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it often passes through isolated stretches of backwoods.
If you're not familiar with the roads of the campaign, be careful: there is a predominance of steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The maximum speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections – commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, curiously, the mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.

The staff are support for the riders who lean on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for riders, but they can have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's legs to get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, many riders wear riding boots with a high heel and a smooth, rather narrow instep.
Subsequently, certain types, particularly English types, have safety clasps that allow the staff's skin strap to detach from the harness if it is pulled back by a falling rider.

Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make light of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the property by marking or defacing graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Between the two, half the people prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone practically knows how to speak Spanish.
