This confirms not only the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but it provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as their colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with an underside of straw color or carotenoïdal color.
The discovery also provides a first look at the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed structure, a strong rachis, but have, on the contrary, other feather tracts – barbicels and barbules – paleontologists concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than those other tracts.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scapula shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
The paleontologists suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scute shows adult plumage and no down feathers.

I found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to plasma flow.
Therefore, the number of Rossby waves is smaller, and therefore the star is less active with respect to magnetic inversions.

Candidates may send representatives to be witnesses to the proceedings. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla received burns on his arm and chest, while Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon worked while it was puncturing the head of a fifth person. Schneider has persistent pain, blindness in one eye, a missing section of his skull, and a reconstructed face made from titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his country of origin.
After the competition on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championships.
His first event was the slalom, where he achieved a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in that run.
In her other run, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary who finished in ninth place.
Four members of the women's group finished their races, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom qualified for the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen mobile phone and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who violated the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are designated by the names Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
Poor man, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
I was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been since accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of the murder of his son.
She is detained pending her indictment and trial, but any evidence of eyewitness testimony could be tainted by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is a frequent practice elsewhere, but in the United Kingdom, Scottish justice functions differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes, "Journalists seem to be truly walking a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which generally deals with legal proceedings, has informed journalists that no additional commentary will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the itinerary, will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the Six-Day War of the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics that would have been discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, provided an agreement is signed, whereas the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The checks of the supplementary counter-control of the populations of interest must be closely monitored by the guards, as the check is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are being recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim director of conservation and heritage of the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received complete safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore before a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth term as President in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Citizen Economic and Social Council (CEP) as part of the package of measures that will lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was responsible for Martelly in the face of widespread demonstrations against the regime that began in October.
Some demonstrations that were violent were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Here, 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that he had been informed of 27 accidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing the postponement of Apple's report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office declared that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino elderly police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by ramming their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier today, just as the Filipino photographers were.
The photographers then took a picture of an elderly woman who needed to go to the market. Mendoza was knocked down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She completed training as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, she began to study premature labor in her free time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal growth in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders ("black boxes") on Wednesday.
The colleagues who fought also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first love. Luna crossed the night of the two moons. She is truly unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... perhaps even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she finds a better place."
Of the 1400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard reiterated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this viewpoint, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist in gold had to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his weight, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain he had because of the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number so far on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery by using computer material and software from the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly have been the source of the water delivery to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
It refers to rumors as "bla bla politics and stupidity."
It is speculated that he/she will present himself/herself as president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, in opposition to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is arranged, and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parking facilities are unavailable on site.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial islands of the Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, and although it was thought that this process would take longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic to the Galapagos, *Geospiza fortes*, and the cactus finch immigrant, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked to make all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled well into very small forms.
It can be pulled to become a thin thread, which can be twisted and drawn. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and fitted into another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the illustrations that appear in illuminated manuscripts.
It seems like the chemical pH has been reached. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The color of litmus changes depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity (basic) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) within the chemical product being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry flours together with clean and damp hands, and form them into a ball.
The humidity on your hands will react with the outer shells, which will give you a strange sensation and form a kind of crust.
The villas of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had common water features in almost every house, highlighted by a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of systems from the Bronze Age have been found in the houses of the Minoan villas of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
I also had commonalities in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, commonalities were sometimes a part of the bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket plume of over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The most important contribution that the wheel has made for us is to give us a means of transport much easier and much faster.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport have brought us.
If there are felines of a medium size that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small felines (including stray domestic cats) that eat the most numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the "capleta," a special concept that each cat has and which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are habitually closely linked to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion's dens act like ambush points for wolves or dogs, animals resembling lions in a surprising way in behavior (but not other felines) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained tiger can climb (though not very well yet), swim, jump long distances, and exert five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Those four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of reborn and howled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch mice, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings.
When a small group of living causes (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different strategies or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was needed before.
The original population hasn't changed much and still needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is to say, breathe out).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with a supplementary grinding plate in the roof of its mouth, which meant there was no way to escape anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but there may have been a fork-tongued language. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other dinosaurs, and it's possible they were also cannibals.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; and even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have stood a chance against it.
Even if the majority of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebratory elements, which included wild boars, peacocks, squabs, and a type of roasted pig called missara.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their food while seated on stools, while the wealthy men enjoyed feasts together where they were scattered on the side, eating their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, he had no wheat, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single old Roman had ever tasted a plum.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests attempted to provide for the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each monastery had an outer courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, where there are special pyramidal towers, sounding like ziggurats, they were built to be a part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Eastern Mediterranean, the house wasn't so important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life unfolded outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were nothing more than open tables facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no important forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. It is said in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, when he sailed further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond their discovery, the Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Even though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
No, that's not true. And even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse side.
And yet, if no one knows of a sure way to write it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be kept.
And so, it is probable that the notation was added simply as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy." They were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American forces and the French liberated forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, a relative of the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and which also defines, in a certain way, the dimension of society.
The city-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization culture implies the passing of knowledge across different generations, a lasting cultural heritage, and an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, since it had no executive or judicial national power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
There was neither an authority to override fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took control of the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team to have achieved the most success in the entire world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in the international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh-largest island in the world.
For the sake of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographic point of view, an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous cereals and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared that Taiwan was a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the properties on the sides of the complex have been renovated in order to give tourists a better idea of the appearance they originally had.
Around 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio coefficient has been inherited by image sensor formats in digital cameras in a more significant way.
The 35mm format is in reality, somewhat distorted, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many frequent formats (the APS format family, for example) are equivalent in terms of being close to this aspect relationship.
The rule of thirds, which is bravely abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves a measure of order within an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was the object of a minimal examination.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Their omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and that concentration of power and money made many people wonder if this principle was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain demarcated international waters to prevent all vessels from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Given that there was a limited response to that tactic, Germany hopes for a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with $400 to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his patron in his previous work) for Thomas Edison.
The old Chinese had a unique way of describing the different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that was in power represented a distinct dynasty.
I also had, between each dynasty, an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of those periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a fierce war raged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to control the highest ground in the grand palace in Xi'an.
I have strong social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, professions were open to all candidates, men and women, which allowed the most ambitious and brilliant people to succeed.
It's the same for the military because instead of having military rankings based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He would frequently visit a hermitage that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Light" (Noor) for contemplation.
The "quita balma," which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Perched on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the hermitage is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it is not easy to find, and even more so if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the clear and peaceful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "arquet naut" brand looks like a V, and the "arquet bas" brand looks like a staple or a hanging sign that's missing its background.
Upwards means you should start at the top and release the bolt, and downwards means you should start at the bottom (where your hand holds the bolt) and pull the bolt.
A high-pitched voice is usually a softer sound, while a low voice is stronger and more assertive.
You must feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the marks imprinted are here for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were sent back to Paris by a crowd of women from the market on October 6, 1789, from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a throng of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the sides of their carriage completely open.
For a moment, a member of the crowd struck the head of a royal guard who was in front of the terrified queen at Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to recover the money from a large portion of the expenses and interest of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Certainly, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that incited the creation of the order.
The period in which those facts unfolded is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the beginning of the Middle Ages and followed by the end of the Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological impact or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humankind is driven by a underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has inherent, rather than socially conditioned, effects on societies.
For example, one could claim that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
A network of national roads is not economically viable for just a handful of vehicles, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The excessive possession of vehicles also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques of healing to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with society's place, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion in the world, Constantinople was perceived as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Their reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century essentially because of the fact that the Crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that moment that the transfer of the capital of fashion from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic art reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major advancements of that era was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture carried out for the production of food sufficient to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system, using saved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together groups of individuals with similar ideas who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Social groups can be distinguished by reason of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequent methods employed to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, abuse, or deliberate maltreatment, were not socialized by adults during the time they were growing up.
Those children are called "feres" or wild ones. Some wild children were confined by people (usually the absent parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability of a child.
It is possible that the feral children suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or escaping.
Some others are supposedly injured by animals; it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within its physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal it adopts, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting way to learn, the school goes a step further.
Empont is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as using new software or starting a new project.
The Emponts can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of Empont, but so is the Microsoft Office "trombone man."
Virtual Emponts are internalized within the software and function to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
The children are placed in foster care for a significant number of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family welcoming system is supposed to provide safe homes, affectionate care staff, stable education, and feasible health care.
Host families are expected to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of Internat lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued relationships" were also identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The collection of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out that people who were unable to understand a speech due to brain damage were therefore able to estimate sincerity with precision.
I suggest that more than such capacities of interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
The research of the 20th century has demonstrated that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation in both senses among all two chromosomes in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the resources available in plants.
But, not to act will have serious consequences: growth tremors, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible vegetal resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like ourselves, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, larvae, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a large quantity of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our distant ancestors solved their "protein problem" to a certain extent in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately staying awake during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively subtle guide to lead you towards consciousness without fully revealing it.
If you find yourself needing to restart the device during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will oblige you to get out of bed to help it.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in inverse correlation to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The sole cause that lies on the path to this awakening is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was spread through the path of love of Mahayana and through Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the divinity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war, confrontations of systems, processes, and culture led to a rift between these countries.
After two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the following 40 years and would be fought fiercely, with armed proxies, from battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already faltering, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Suddenly, these plans became obsolete almost immediately, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, and at the same time interfere with the ability of its enemy to move its people and goods.
One of the most recent examples worthy of mention is the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, was attempting to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats apparently were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to have easy access to the fleece, the furs, the meat, and the hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pastureland, often watched over by shepherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still used today.
The iron railway cars were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the ironways simply consisted of parallel wooden posts, they allowed horses pulling them to attain greater speeds and to haul heavier loads than on the slightly rougher routes of that time.
Crossbars have been introduced from now on to keep the rails in place. However, it was later realized that the tracks would be more efficient with an iron plate on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron never caused wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first means of transport known was walking; humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
In the mornings, the australopithecines didn't walk upright as they usually did.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and even Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start by living more respectfully of the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce the future suffering of some kind.
It's not just a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we would need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have become more significant due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a draft written and signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks further to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the entire night, between 150 and 200 specimens were made, now known as the "Dunlap folios".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. An exemplar arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 folios of Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript written by hand has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. Their names are birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many reasons why birds evolved from dinosaurs.
Walking with scales and harps, he carries eggs and walks on his two posterior legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, when using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic chemicals from the home.
You must check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific venom.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with ticks, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both lambs and assassin snails are both nudibranchs, adapted to live in a shell or the dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 homes known to have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
The research found that women have twice the likelihood of having multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple might decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to have a baby.
Those couples could choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents put an end to their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world functions through the scientific method. This method actually guides the majority of scientific research.
It's not just that, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and the philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
Since the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free cycle period, even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They carried out two experiments in labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations within germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can only cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
The examples of activities on the square include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small villages in the countryside in cars to go to their place of work, and they pass by others whose destination of work is the place they have just left.
Inside this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private vehicles in one way or another.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely see levels of complaints comparable to those regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why don't they function as they should in daily life? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Generally, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought that it was reasonable, but many people believed the contrary; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems sensible, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It transports more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six kilometers wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that rivers on the planet pour into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River, the main one, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed for their size and the excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admiring of the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life for the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can be discovered all within nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
There has never been a time like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and even though it has been theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You must not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
I can also have alloys that contain small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the great flood was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It is sad, but with the appearance of new writing methods, the quill has been relegated to a smaller status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computers or on computer screens, without ever having to hide from a stalker.
A man can only ask when the harrow will be sold when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to split a nucleus and separate protons and neutrons.
It's a little like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Breaking it down will then release the core, allowing part of that energy to be freed.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with the slightest push or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is colder at sea and more exposed in the highlands.
I can never have Mars on the near side because the crust is very thin. It is very easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding things that resonate with people or things that are of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized over time as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what there is for certain people that gives them envy of the causes that they do and which causes in their environment will make them do or not do certain causes.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when directors begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to maintain "one of the types" (or the women).
This type of manager has difficulties making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another transformed into an individual barely recognizable, sensing that he or she had to change everything that had equipped them and appropriate it.
Ultimately, the coach is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of their team.
This behavior very often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often, they have more autonomy than conventional team members, as teams can be formed based on varying time zones that may not be covered by their local administration.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team establishes the rules for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is a key outcome when one puts into practice organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the procedure of an organization that functions together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new and innovative process to serve the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuist approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. Therefore, it limits the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has been known for some time that different types of brain lesions, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never before observed.
This provides us with a stream of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes within our mind.
Even though artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation within a machine.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning and creation of schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Of such causes come from separate disciplines, which focus on the task of providing solutions to the real problems of living.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built in various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. A teacher would often like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can examine artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while they are with their class.
Sharing a virtual outing is also an excellent way to relax after a hike and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are archived online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is starting to make good efforts to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Currently, blogging "forces students to come across as more jaded regarding the world around them." The need to cultivate the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to online material, students can define their positions within the context of other writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the pleasant bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a fine array of art galleries and museums that exhibit the past and present of Canada.
Niagara Falls is located much further south, and the north is the region of unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these factors and more enhance Ontario's value in what is considered the quintessence of all things Canadian by foreigners.
The large plains in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost wild, uninhabited regions.
To make a population comparison that greatly surprises people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest from afar, and a continent unique for its wild animals.
The majority of the smallest islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it established itself significantly in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from the Cape of Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all women say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that seems too ostentatious).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You must be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend the territory (cultural differences or not, that's not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city like Daru l-Bayda, and the Spanish merchants who had established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop for everything in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, leather goods, heart-shaped objects, hookahs, and a whole range of things, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's quarries, particularly the city center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma must be studied to understand the state of the ongoing fighting within the North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla tracking experiences.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to make the trip to Goma. The normal (local) fare is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctoo" has become employed as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a vulnerable city, and although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major segments during the special episode "African Wonders" by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The town is in stark contrast with the rest of the towns in the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblematic brand of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all the national parks of South Africa, you have to pay preservation and entrance fees each day to enter the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the national parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be their main interest.
The collection of buildings that create Hong Kong's horizon has led to comparisons with a shining bar graph, made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and head towards Kowloon Waterfront directly facing it.
The immense majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as if it were their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with an extension of 80 km (50 miles) in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest area within the Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps for that reason—they include some of the last remaining parcels of the powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the forest.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, and even though the majority, particularly those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the villages of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017 when it is expected that the customs controls of the Brazilian authorities will be completed.
The Guaranis were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was the homeland of other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has strived to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the entire world.
The most important event of the year unfolds in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To get news about the tournaments and find out where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has the same value as a British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the sole bank of the islands, which is located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted where there are islands and inland in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, and while British and American currency may be taken, verify with the owners in advance to determine what method of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Malvinas currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even if many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the fauna is therefore wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It's not important if they seem docile; bison, wapitis, elk, bears, and almost all beautiful animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
However, you must be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or storing unwanted food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded during the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the location of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city resulted in the death of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
It has many beaches, because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The beaches of North Shore (within the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay to the north and Devonport to the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shady spots provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
They are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes very crowded and have a good range of shops lined up along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
I have more French wines to drink, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is a good option if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is served with very little foam (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate meets the high standards of Belgium. The fruit pastries are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the mountains are made throughout the year, and accidents due to some of these causes in the mountains are rare.
Therefore, you must take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear close to the beaches and the estuaries of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of those times.
Lamias exist in reality, and rarely attack humans. Most lamias are afraid of humans and would flee by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, and although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers both to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights with hotel stays.
You can also hold the reservation if you need time to consider the proposal or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any modification or request regarding a booking should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
In many festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most consider this a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get up early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special countryside activities for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, you must verify the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice can be a serious danger for the people most affected.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
Habitually offering special foods and drinks, and suggestions for entertainment, to keep customers in good spirits and to keep them coming back.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the premises. However, drunkenness impairs judgment and all good players know that it's important to remain sober.
Those who are tasked with driving to high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of finding snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, snow that can immobilize you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or wind-blown snow, by condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the conditions of good ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is carried out in a nearly uninterrupted manner throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the main draw for many visitors.
The commonly used term "safari" refers to land journeys to observe the magnificent African fauna, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to huddle near vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for close observation of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and you'll see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walk," "safari excursion," or a hike) consists of walking, for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might have a precarious situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, the majority of coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of tickets for the competitions will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with typical tickets costing around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many irons have an ironing board available for loan, and there's never a shortage of them in the room.
If a smoothing iron is not available or you don't really want to wear ironed trousers, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
You must be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases indoors, nice burns).
There are different methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, a few rolls of water for a minute is enough; in others, several minutes are necessary.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and in case of a disaster, you should consider then buying your water in a bottle sealed by a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animals in the regions of their origin.
Nails can harbor food particles, cause irritation, or, within the confines of homes, trigger allergic reactions, spread bacteria, or transmit infections.
Quarantine measures for infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can severely injure or kill people, do not fall into the category of harmful causes.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and special charges in certain locations.
Travelers heading towards countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated forested areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm spirit: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections—frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Curiously, the mobile phone service is quite strong here compared to many other parts of the itinerary, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German-style dumplings are very good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruits in the pastry shop are abundant, with ripe apples in jars all year round, and cherries and plums that appear during the summer.
Mante's German pastries baked in the oven also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. These traditional cakes harmonize particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, served with either meat or legumes.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is coconut milk that is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that covers a vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine boasts a range of simply seasoned dishes. The predominant flavors favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can create safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to get trapped.
If a knight is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he can be pulled back if the horse flees. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, the majority of knights wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Immediately, some cells, particularly the angled cells, have safety bars that allow a rider's body to fall from the cell if they are pulled backward by a falling rider.
The Val de Cochamó - Chile's first climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
The summits offer impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between the infinite potential of the walls.
Snow sports like downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve gliding across snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski vagabonds," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old—paintings in caves depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Going for ski walks: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
He isn't a member of the family, but he doesn't usually enjoy alpine skiing excursions or mountaineering, those latter activities involving steep terrain and requiring skis and much stiffer boots.
You must think of a ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you could cover relatively greater distances than walking – but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa requests and passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, in a way, functions somewhat like a country in this case.
Within the extent that you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints anymore.
Furthermore, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and thus you will save time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is known to have geographical variations, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as old, even if they are more recent than similar products manufactured in mass.
Reindeer herding is an important source of resources for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sami people have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, keeping the reindeer primarily as animals for pulling sleds.
Today, many Sami people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
However, although it is currently used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gitans" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you visit is subject to recommendations for travelers, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, but their advice is usually intended for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could be confronted with different situations than those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any type of meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Violent regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sleet storms.
It is strongly advised for travelers to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that may affect their destination and that could affect all their travel plans.
Those who plan to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A web search for 'cors for hostile environments' will probably provide the address of a local company.
A proper course should normally address all the subjects discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many elements of first sounds, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that come from the wild regions are frequent, but publications that come from war zones are scarce.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to correspond to a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor those documents is simply variable everywhere.
The security checkpoints at airports have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender pre-operative individuals should not have to wait to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The tidal currents are the receding waters that separate from the beach, often around a rock or something nearby.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deep sections, and a rapid current can form towards the deep waters.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim to the shore against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to direct yourselves to a place where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on your abilities and if you have been noted, you may want to wait for rescue.
The post-vacation blues arrive sooner than culture shock (and last less than a honeymoon), last longer and can be even harder.
The travelers who have had the ease to adapt to their new culture have times when it is particularly difficult to readjust to their culture of origin.
When you return to your home after having lived abroad, you are adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your culture of origin.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
It's possible that people don't anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their homes.
The spectacle of snow and lights is one of the most interesting reasons for children to visit the Christmas market.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors from far away. The story of the sounds and lights is simply like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and host the largest number of research stations, with seventeen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other places like Livingston Island and Deception have a caldera flooded by a still-active volcano, creating a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plain, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4892 m at Vinson Mountain.
In remote places, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, and also by expeditions that require data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
One option increasingly popular for those planning to take a gap year is to travel to learn.
It is something particularly popular among students who are finishing school, allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program for a sabbatical year can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your country of origin.
I will generally have school enrollment forms to register for those educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed very large for all kinds of boats, the smallest boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's quite unique on the other hand (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
The majority of different Baltic cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the night boat.
If you stay on land only within the framework of ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, in Germany, among the destinations. As you can see on the map here, Berlin is not very close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and in all circumstances, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not like there's anything to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions caused by other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or a feeling of being unable to regain control.
Messenger companies are well paid for delivering items quickly. Frequently, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the most important companies had their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If the causes had been sent by air freight, along certain routes, it is possible that it would have taken several days to pass through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to get rid of it more quickly was to send it as baggage in the suitcase. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is illogical.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a good amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not a good deal: in general, you can expect to pay up to at least four times the normal price in economy class for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class on direct flights from point A to point B.
The airlines know well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, that conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Before the old city of Smyrna, it is now a modern commercial operations center, developed and occupied, situated around an immense bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with stone facades, and the modern shopping centers are capped with traditional red-tiled roofs, as are the 18th-century market and the old mosques and churches, even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting sculptures of marble doves on some tombs.
It was worth half an hour of a walk in this strange village.
To the north, and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a widely circulated account of its splendors, documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a sacred place), a site of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
For your pleasure, remember to visit especially a mass grave and also a site that has a nearly incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and even more who had loved ones who were murdered or who died working, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make any light of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by writing or drawing graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Here, about half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually all know Spanish.
However, the majority of the panels are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Therefore, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made solely in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
And yet, it's often not an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to show your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "well-mannered" (well-educated). This will make you get by in a considerably easier way.
The Parisians' rough exteriors will quickly evaporate if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is strikingly wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a notably wide variety of plant communities, owing to its range of microclimates, diverse soils, and variable altitudes.
The meadow also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
If one can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, lynx, wildcat, and wild peacock, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear shawls that cover their knees and to have their shoulders covered as well.
The majority of monasteries provide shawls to women who haven't come prepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you'll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Within the same logic, he wondered if men should wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be taken from the reservation at the entrance, but this outfit isn't washed after each user and therefore you might not feel comfortable wearing those knee pads. One size fits all men!
The Balearic cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean islands, is based on bread, legumes, and meat (generally pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, rustic meal, especially during the summer, is bread with oil: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and all kinds of company available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, along with the pronoun "you," always begin with a capital letter, and never in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and their objects.
Without a doubt, it makes reading easier, even if the writing is a little complicated due to the need to discover whether a verb or adjective is used under a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters that need attention are c, e, and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means car, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to Persian grammar will help you learn many things about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
It is useless to say that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can conclude readily that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are typically obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at its peak was not the type of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built during the modern era.
The majority of modern research telescopes are large installations located in remote, high-altitude areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing the cherry blossom, which is known as hanami, is part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated from China, where the blossoms of the privet were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were reserved for the emperor and only for him and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have a better appearance when they are in a natural environment, so you must resist the temptation to pull out just "one" specimen.
If you visit a garden arranged in a formal way, picking a few "specimens" will also get you thrown out, without a doubt.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But since it is situated in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to manage both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, but rarely).
I also have some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
You need to verify that the bus you think you are taking goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement neighboring Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base for a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Léris Valley, the Rhine Valley, or going on a ski trip to interesting sites on the Danube or taking a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
Define also routes for popular hiking trails and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
More than one of the traditions that surround the festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries throughout the world.
I have a tradition of spending Easter Eve staying up late in some exposed place to see the sun rise.
There are surely Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many traditional churches often celebrate an Easter Vigil on the Saturday night before Easter Sunday, with congregations often beginning the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands arrived either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the principal animal to appear in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
Since the airfields are sparsely populated, and light pollution is consequently often not a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
The customs are to wear standard work clothes and colleagues greet each other by their family name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual performance.
Workers must often obtain the approval of their superiors for all the decisions they make, and it is expected that they will obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
