Although an experimental vaccine appears to be effective in reducing Ebola mortality, no treatment has yet proven sufficiently adequate for treating existing infections.
The cocktail of antibodies called ZMapp initially showed promise, but official studies have shown that it is not as effective in preventing Ebola mortality as was initially expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a starting point and compared three other treatments to it.
The Gymnastics Federation of the USA supports the letter of the US Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that, in the interest of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, it would be better to continue with significant changes within our organization, rather than a decertification.

Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or cartanoid-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed axis called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation and display. The researcher's stance is that, although it is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample suggests it is plumage from an adult individual, not a juvenile.
Researchers have indicated that, although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult individual rather than bird down.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.
A statement from the governor's office announced that nineteen police officers are among the injured.
Police have stated that they suspect the alleged ISIS fighter is responsible for the attack.
They concluded that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: it has been established that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity and rotation, and by nothing else.
Intensity and rotation are used together to determine the Rayleigh number of the star, which relates to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reconfiguration.

Middle-order batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid performed well and had a partnership of 100 meters. **Note:** There seems to be a slight inaccuracy in the original Serbian sentence. "Сто метара" literally means "one hundred meters." It's likely referring to a score of 100 runs, but the phrasing is unusual. I've translated it as "100 meters" to be as faithful as possible to the original, but the context suggests a score. A more natural translation focusing on the likely meaning would be: "Middle-order batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid performed well and had a 100-run partnership."
However, after losing captain's wicket, India only managed 36 runs and lost 7 wickets by the end of their innings.

"Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is clear to say so given that these are deep holes in the ground," stated Glen Cushing of the U.S. team for geological and astrogeological investigations and from the University of Northern Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters go into a booth alone and place the printed ballot paper with the chosen candidate marked in a ballot box.
When the officials verify the voter's identity, he inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French election law very strictly codifies the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except those from the prescribed number of counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The weapon stopped just as it was pointed at the fifth man's head. Schneider constantly feels pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a piece of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with the help of titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF (United States Air Force) base in his home country.
Besides the competition on Wednesday, Карпанедо competed in two individual races at the Championship.
Her first race was Slalom, where she finished her first race with "Did not finish." 36 of 116 competitors have the same result in that race.
In her second race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's group, with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Giongy Dani from Hungary.
Four women skiers in the seated category failed to finish their races, and 45 of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to make the race ranking.
The police of Mađar Pradeš found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy General Inspector D. K. Arja said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kandjar, Buta Kandjar, Rampro Kandjar, Gaza Kandjar, and Vishna Kandjar.
Police supervisor Čanda Šekar Solanki stated that the released individuals appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoa was subsequently accused in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh of murdering her son.
She is in pre-trial detention awaiting the indictment and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses could be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is a common practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: "It seems that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish images of suspects or anything else."
The Scottish Public Prosecution Service, which has general jurisdiction over criminal prosecution, has told journalists that there will be no further comments until a charge is brought.
According to leaked information, the document will concern the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other discussed topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a city for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestinian authorities agree that this presence will exist for only five years.
Shooting teams in the pest control supplementary operation were to be under strict ranger supervision, given that the operation was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Thanks to the partnership between NPWS and the organization known as the Australian Sports Archers Association (NSW), qualified volunteers have been engaged within the hunting program of the Australian Sports Archers Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park and heritage protection at NPWS, the four snipers selected for the initial targeting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
The new election commission (CEP) of nine members took an oath yesterday under Martelj.
That is Martel's fifth electoral commission in four years.
Last month, the parliamentary commission recommended the previous resignation of the Election Commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to push the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martel's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests are caused by the non-holding of elections, some of which are overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPod devices overheating have been reported, leading to a total of six fires, but also minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the specified devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "minor."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM Friday GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins started to research premature births in his free time.
His research showed that the application of hormones could accelerate fetal maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" on Wednesday, which contain flight records.
Colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomi Drimer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away two months ago. Very uniquely like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldast" Ranels commented: "Luna was just as strange as I am... maybe even more so... I like her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard campaigned in the 2010 federal election, stating that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold Olympic medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness is in doubt.
He couldn't get the medication he needed for pain because it was banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water that came to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets have collided with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said about the rumors that they were "political chatter and nonsense."
It is being said in public that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, unlike earlier technologies based on ground-based radars, so that air traffic controllers can determine a more precise position of the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport being put on above-ground trains will stop at Wembley, and parking lots and "park and ride" facilities are not available above ground.
Fear of a lack of transport has increased the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
Research published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reports on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process takes much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into fine forms.
It can be processed into the form of a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be worked with a hammer or rolled into sheets.
It could be made in a very thin form, or even glued onto some other metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating pictures in books known as "illustrated (illuminated) manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical solution is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (considering that hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix those two dry powders together and then, using damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowls in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the sewage system have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women were together in the same social setting.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then returns it back to Earth almost instantly.
A rocket launched a satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a massive rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us is that it enabled much easier and faster transportation.
That brought us a train, a car, and many other vehicles.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats as pets) that eat a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a unique role that each cat fulfills, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social among cats and live in large groups known as prides.
Pods consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually in close familial relation, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb a tree (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and exert five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a sentence full of sharper, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if they can, birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and seek animals that will eat (prey) by scent, by smelling the place on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pounce on their target.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originates from (for example, if they migrate over a mountain range or river, or if they migrate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it was previously needed to be.
The original population has not changed in the slightest, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We make houses from plants and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 teeth, sharp as razors, along with an extra set of teeth on the hard palate, meaning nothing that came his way could escape.
We cannot claim with certainty, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex would not be a match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a puffin.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting at tables, the wealthy liked to organize banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted chicken.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests would attempt to please the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of it and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Once upon a time, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The majority of the daily life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although every country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is drawn on the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, printed on the wrong side.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere at the beginning of its creation, this great document on parchment (its dimensions are 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Well, most likely the tag was added simply as a mark.
The landing on D-Day and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
She was led by the "Vishevski" French. These were Frenchmen who, in 1940, reconciled with the Germans and joined them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the Free French liberated southern France and moved on towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e., society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning "citizenly," and is connected to the Latin *civis*, meaning "citizen," and *civitas*, meaning "city" or city-state. This also somehow defines the size of a community.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Less cultured societies typically disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and are therefore often not recognized as true civilizations.
While the war for independence was being fought, thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative in the implementation of all their legal documents.
He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before members could be changed, and the states so readily understood the central administration that their representatives were often absent from the sessions.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called an "archipelago" on geographical maps.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of this island as "Ilha Formosa," or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of the indigenous agricultural practices of grain production, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, by which Japan gained sovereignty over Taiwan, which it controlled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photos in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but what is even more important is that its aspect ratio has been inherited by image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
It is considered that the aspect ratio of this format is 3:2 (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest ratio in the form of whole numbers).
Many common formats (let's say the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly close to this dimension.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining a sense of order in the image.
It states that the most impressive place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be subjected to oversight.
Christian religion has connected European markets for thousands of years, despite differences in language and customs.
With her inexhaustible power, she influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being upheld.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
It has been shown that the strategy is effective, as it disrupted the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering vast parts of the ocean, thereby posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing views of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and war atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job at the New York company Edison, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss from his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each period of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred between many clans who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the vast palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, positions were open to all men who applied, allowing the more ambitious and successful to succeed.
It also applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on connections/influence.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people from the working class in other countries to spark their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life. He often went to the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived many ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's difficult to find, even if someone knows it exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing more can be seen except the clear, magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the numerous large pyramidal structures that pay tribute to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The label "with onion" looks like a V, and "a string of onion labels" resembles a clip or a square missing its bottom side.
"Up" means you should start from the top and push the string, while "down" means to start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
Raising the bow usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the bow produces a louder and more assertive one.
Feel free to write your markings with a pen, but remember that the printed notes are present for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to retreat to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of women from the market.
They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were screaming and shouting threats directed at the king and queen.
The mob ordered the king and queen to fully open the carriage windows.
At one point, a member of the royal guard waved his head before the horrified queen, the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles.
The citizens of the Philippines themselves paid for the war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA in order to cover the majority of the costs and interest on securities that had circulated in Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, and it is a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is governed by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development proceeds along a path that is independent of cultural and political influences, and that, in turn, technology has its own "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
Nevertheless, the national road network is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher frequency of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture linked to that geography would emerge, and these were, in accordance with the social context, superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
At this very time, the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was carried out.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be lagging by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food only for the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seed, local breeds within a given bioregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in independent farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized due to social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnic, class affiliation, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is looking at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accidents, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "brutal" or wild. Some wild children have been locked away by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children happens because parents refuse to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
The children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma in childhood before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When feral children are raised entirely by animals who are not human, they exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the behavior of those animals who cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, learning through the "scaffolding" system goes a step further.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a form of assistance provided to individuals to help them navigate new learning experiences, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is actually a type of support, but also a small glue person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are a component of the software and should review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complex for students to carry out themselves.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster family system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster family system should provide a safe home, caring foster parents, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
Family accommodation for children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important purposes for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Emaj and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "maintaining connections" as new motivational aspects in their research on audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is especially claimed that, if you correctly interpret microexpressions, you can detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," noted that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even believes that such abilities in understanding human behavior might be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes expressed variation from the gene pool.
Segregation and recombination lead to a constant mixing of variations between the two populations in each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive tracts resembling those of humans have difficulty satisfying their amino acid needs from plant sources available to them.
Indeed, if this is not done, serious consequences may occur: the growth of depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Plant resources that were easiest to access were proteins found in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them if they aren't cooked.
Conversely, animal-sourced food (ants, termites, eggs) not only digests easily, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you reset the clock while sleeping, you can put it in another room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but these were expanded by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts between the systems, processes, and cultures led to these two countries falling out.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the struggle would be real, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern parts of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Ocean freight shipping is convincingly the most efficient way to move a large number of people and a large quantity of goods across oceans.
The navy's traditional role has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting their people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and weapons across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, mainly using submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easier access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by shepherds who were usually children or young people, similar to the better-known shepherds. These herd management methods are still used today.
The tracks for the wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat uneven tracks of that time.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This has become a standard practice, but iron caused more damage to wooden wheels.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made of solid iron were used.
The first known form of transportation was walking. People began to walk upright about 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecus, did not walk upright as is commonly believed.
The development of bipedalism was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and extinguish it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humankind.
After adoption by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent in several batches further on, to John Dunlap's printing house.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as "Danlup's pages."
John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time on July 8th in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read to his troops on July 9th in New York. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap manuscript pages that are still known to exist are the oldest existing copies of a document. The original handwritten copy is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two back legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers currently in use are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits in computer jargon.
It doesn't have to be immediately obvious that it's an internal poisoning. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis can't be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medication packages or household toxic chemicals.
Please check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bed bugs and common bed bugs are species that stay with their parents for a long time and are adapted to life in the bed or home of their hosts.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to plan the adoption of a baby.
During adoption, biological parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main task of science is to understand how the world functions by using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observation also lead scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's understanding of all scientific questions, including psychology, was respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many prominent rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms, which are not simply responses to the periodic alternation of external influences, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with their free-running period, even if there are no external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with the help of radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with the help of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna of the wilderness.
Activities in the field include, for example: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their workplaces, often passing by those whose workplaces are exactly where they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this economy of high carbon consumption has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and make mistakes daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their mutual interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable and consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and construction of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives them a wider choice of different hiding places to escape predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are fairyflies and water flowers.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a local width of six miles.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids of Giza in their size and the technical ingenuity of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which had been old for over a thousand years by that time.
The Vatican has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to people since ancient times, considering that they can be found in nature in their native form and can be relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, had a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This more resembled four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic system.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, there are alloys that consist of a small amount of non-metals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in a period at the end of this sentence.
Back then, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People now write messages on computer screens, even though they were never close to using a typewriter.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
That's roughly like pushing heavy strollers uphill. The re-splitting of the core then releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The width of the Korа River is approximately 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Tanja is under the lunar sea, and Deblja is under the hills.
Perhaps there are more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to erupt onto the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they matured into adults.
These theories study what it is in certain people that makes them want to do things, and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of motivation are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two patterns of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning accountability, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people transform into unrecognizable individuals who feel they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a contact person for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones that local management wouldn't understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for applying the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed.
As a result, the process of organization in which people work together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new and innovative process that will meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of productivity.
Non-biological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. This, in turn, narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI strongly evokes science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications, given that it is built into several home computers and software applications for video games.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom. The teacher often likes to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of excursion experiences is also an excellent way to reflect on the experienced trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Benet Academy in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critically minded audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful in relation to the world around them." The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their own positions in the context of other texts, as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada and boasts a whole range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further emphasizes Ontario as something that foreigners basically consider Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For comparison of the population, which surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is convincingly the largest island, and a continent in itself when it comes to wilderness.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely adopted on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to things they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for this to be followed by things like grabbing their hand, etc.
Be decisive in rejecting men and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Cabo Branco, before abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city called Dar l-Badi, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
The Gomma was destroyed in 2002 by a mudslide in Mount Nyiragongo, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is quite safe, any visits outside of Goma should be carefully assessed to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base from which ascents to Mount Nyiragongo volcano begin, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation places it among tourist attractions, and it also has an airport.
Due to the threat of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
That was one of the main locations for Henry Louis Gates during the filming of "The Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
This city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park stretches over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the main attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and park entrance fees.
The purchase of a wildcard ticket should be considered, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is juxtaposed with a clear ribbon-like graph that becomes evident due to the presence of Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong in the best way possible, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban area is densely packed onto reclaimed land along the northern coast.
The British colonizers took this place as their own, so if you're looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been listed as a World Heritage Site under UNESCO protection. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Ganška Plain.
Sundarbans stretches over an area of 3850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/swamp surfaces.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Džakar/Bumtang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minivans, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaka (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 meters in size. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced sustainable agriculture.
The Čako region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guayaku and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the clay courts in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentina Polo Association.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine which form of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the island, so exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; temperatures above 30°C are frequent in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together create a feeling that it's much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild is still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park administration, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, North American and European elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and officially adopted the title of capital city in 1959.
Luka was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruise ship. Almost two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence in the organization of the Mau Movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Considering that Oakland stretches across two bays, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas:
The beaches of the Northern Coast (in the area of Northern Luka) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most of them also have shade provided by the trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Viaduct Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Those are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich variety of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer "Number One" isn't a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines might withstand the journey better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you're worried.
"White double espresso with milk" is a strange concept to Australians. A short black is just an "espresso," cappuccino comes with a generous topping of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but exceptional.
Throughout the year, numerous trips to the ridge are organized, and injuries resulting from any of the aforementioned reasons on the ridge are rare.
However, follow the authorities' advice, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the city, starting in 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this timeframe.
There are sharks, however, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away as far as possible from you.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance makes passengers feel calm knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you might be able to book other types of accommodation such as campsites through them.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel arrangements.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer, or they can obtain other documents you need for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to come early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have stopped, there might be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic Sea during the winter, check the location of the hut, considering that crossing the ice causes quite terrifying sounds for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include the time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money visitors spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it's difficult to find exits.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests are in a good mood and stay at the venue.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning a drive at high latitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below zero.
On icy and snowy roads, grip is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can be limited by falling or flying snow, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is likely the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular use, the term safari refers to land journeys where you can see amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars slowly, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you'll have a better chance of spotting them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "nature walk," "hiking safari," or "walking tour") consists of hiking, which lasts a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, considering it was the host of the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announced postponement, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
The expected price of most event tickets will range from 2500 to 130,000 Japanese Yen, with the price of a typical ticket being around 7000 Yen.
Ironing helps damp clothes dry. Many hotels offer the rental of irons and ironing boards, even if you don't have them in your room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't become too hot (which can lead to shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several ways to purify water, with some giving better results against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Passengers may encounter pests and animals they are unfamiliar with in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
The most dangerous diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person through force are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods免税 (exempt from) taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fermont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
It's interesting, however, that the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds preserve.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are often made with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try small, but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on herbs and spices in combination with meat or vegetables.
Kari can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Considering it encompasses 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
However, if used without additional modifiers, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a wide array of simply seasoned dishes, dominated by flavors preferred by the Javanese, such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but can pose a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but their leg gets caught in the girth, they might be dragged if the horse continues to run. Numerous preventative measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Then, saddles, especially English saddles, should have safety barriers that allow any stirrup to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it when falling.
Kocama Valley - Chile's main destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, views that take your breath away are offered. Mountaineers from all over the world constantly establish new routes among the unexplored potentials of the mountain.
Snow sports in the mountains, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during travel, and many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," plan entire vacations spent skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is exceptionally old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Mountaineering with skiing: This activity is also often called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is connected to, but usually does not include ski touring or alpine climbing; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover a somewhat greater distance than by walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In that regard, the Schengen Area, however, functions similarly to a single state.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without re-entering passport control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas separately for each of the member states of the Schengen area, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Raising reindeer is important for the lives of the Sami, and culture within the framework of trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were largely devoted to cultivating reindeer; they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and used reindeer mainly for pulling and carrying loads.
Today, many Laplanders are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, a region located in the Lapland region.
Although commonly used, especially outside the Roma community, the word "cigarette smoker" is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and incorrect conclusions about Roma people. **Note:** I've translated "циганин" as "cigarette smoker" because it's the most direct and accurate translation, capturing the nuanced meaning of the word which carries a history of derogatory usage. I've also kept the clarification in the translation to explain the context. A more sensitive translation might use "Roma person" or "Romani person" depending on the desired level of formality and emphasis.
If the country you plan to visit becomes subject to travel recommendations, it may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You might also wish to hear advice from the governments of other countries, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks associated with bad weather in the area where they are located, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wishes to travel to a country that could be called a war zone must first undergo professional training.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an internet search, you will probably get the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, primarily with practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and journals dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of the government to issue passports that do not specify the person's sex (X) or documents that are updated to reflect the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is equally varied.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to be allowed through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Turbulent currents represent a return flow of waves that separate from the shore, often present at the crest or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a strong current can be created down to deep water.
The majority of deaths occur due to exhaustion when attempting to swim upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than it normally is.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock upon returning occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it can sometimes be particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The show with sounds and lights in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and narrator of a long tale.
Scenes are shown on pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
On the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, many nations claim rights and have the most bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Elsworth's land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plain, and then reappear to form a 360 km mountain range called Ellsworth, divided by the Minnesotan Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are located the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak, Vinson Point, reaching 4892 m.
In remote locations, where there is no mobile phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, because in order to make a call, you have to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used when traveling by boat, including yachts, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who are finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a break in studies can improve prospects for advancement towards higher education in one's home country.
Generally, there is tuition to enroll in some of these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and on the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand agree on this, but it's otherwise very unique (for example, in the Netherlands that number ranges from one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit a historic city for a couple of full days and return and sleep on the boat overnight.
If you only go to the coast within the framework of boat excursions, you do not need a special visa (since 2009).
In the brochures, Berlin in Germany is highlighted as part of some cruises. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes regarding other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or the inability to have control over events.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery of goods. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other routes or smaller companies.
If they shipped items via air freight, it's possible that on some routes, it took days to go through customs and unloading.
The only way to get through faster was to send the luggage as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send the luggage without the passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to set aside a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, persuade the company you work for to do it for you instead).
However, this isn't cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than a regular economy ticket for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point even trying to find discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a group of passengers willing to pay extra for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered as a result of ethnic conflict.
This conflict in 1994 resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very well-connected transportation hub.
Once a древни град (ancient city), Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass walls, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional roofs of red tiles, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of the atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombs.
It's worth setting aside half an hour for a walk through the intriguing village.

Please be aware that you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a place of almost incalculable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived a stay here, and even more who have had their loved ones murdered or enslaved to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with dignity, seriousness, and respect, as it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the location by making marks or scratching graphite on objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Around half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and in fact, everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the labels are only in Catalan, considering it was established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used quite a bit in public transportation and other locations.
Regular announcements in the subway are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are automatically published in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, unkind, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave politely – like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make your maneuvering much easier.
Rude behavior from Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptionally wide spectrum of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, varying soils, and diverse levels of altitude.
This area is also habitat for an exceptionally large number of diverse animal and bird species.
Here, you can find rare animal species, including the brown bear, wolf, golden eagle, owl, lynx, wild cats, and the great bustard, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own skirt, especially one with bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Following the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
And you can also borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each wearing, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. It's a universal size for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like those in similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and generally uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available additions such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie," which means "You" (formal), are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or an adverb is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced as they are written.
The basic letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following consonant.
Also, make an effort to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "karo" means dear, while "karro" means carriage.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook would help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you speak any Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to have to be learned separately.
Predmodern observatories are largely obsolete today, and exist as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem during their flourishing time, they can usually be found in cities or campuses, where they were more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best when in a natural environment, so resist the urge to remove "even one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, you will also be ejected by collecting "specimens," and that without discussion.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place to visit and very easy to get around in, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, considering its location in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rare).
The park bus also goes north to Hebron, where the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes directly to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arbei.
Rivers and waterways inland can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, a visit to the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Istrian canals.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night without sleeping, in some open place in order to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this spring and fertility ritual originated before the emergence of Christians.
Traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, while communities often begin celebrating as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not travel, making the giant tortoise the primary animal that grazes on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, considering that the sky will be dark more or less throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution often isn't a problem, so you'll be able to enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is hierarchically structured and more formal than what Westerners might be used to.
She went to the business attire store, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to ask their superiors for approval for every decision they make, and they are also expected to follow their superiors' instructions without complaint.
