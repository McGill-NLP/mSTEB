What this confirms, at the very least, is that some dinosaurs had feathers – a theory already widely accepted – but he also offers details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scholars say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotene-colored on the underside.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not contain a fully evolved skeletal chain, called the "vertebral column," but possess other feather characteristics – such as barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the vertebral column was likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The wing structure suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers propose that despite this tail belonging to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers rather than a chick-like rump.
Researchers pointed out that despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult bird, not those of a chick.

As for the completed work, most of it is theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Milky Way galaxy.
The effect that the team was searching for stems from massive, fundamental forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way galaxy attracts the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
That theory clarifies that most dark matter around a galaxy resides in a halo-like structure surrounding it, composed of small particles in large numbers.

All I ask of people is that they treat us as we treat them.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that bans the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill project stipulates the placement of a label written on it "18" on violent video games sold in the state of California, and a fine of $1000 per offense will be imposed for selling them to minors.
The Director of Public Prosecution, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of both Honee and Price.
He has resigned and he will be replaced in the Council of Ministers by Member of Parliament Ed Davey. It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will take over the job of Minister of Business, which Davey will leave.
Huwain and Bryce have a scheduled appearance at the Westminster Judges Court on the 16th of Safar.
Among the losses was Nicolas Aldin, 25 years old, and Zacharie Kodibac, 21 years old. Kodibac was the driver.
Edgar Figueredo sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
Schneider is suffering from persistent pain, blindness in one eye, and the loss of a part of his skull, with his face rebuilt from titanium. All of this happened while the "Oka" weapon malfunctioned while aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a US Air Force base in his country.
Following Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom ski race, where she received a "did not finish" result in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
Her other race – the giant slalom ski race – saw her finish in tenth place in the women's seated category with a run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Claudia Luchs of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyeonggi Danyi of Hungary.
Four para-skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their heats, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to place in the race.
The police recovered the stolen computer and mobile phone belonging to Madhia Bardish.
Deputy Inspector General Di. K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Botha Kanga, Rambro Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He had initially been admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adikuya became accused in the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh of murdering her son.
She is being held in detention awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be suspect because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other places in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts have considered that publishing the images is likely to be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are definitely heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or similar concerning suspects."
The office of the Crown Prosecution, generally responsible for claims, informed journalists that there would be no further comments until at least an indictment is issued.
The document, according to the leak, will reportedly refer to the dispute over borders, with Palestine wanting them based on the borders prior to the war in 1387 AH in the Middle East.
The other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel continues to demand a military presence in the Golan Heights for ten years, upon signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence for only five years.
The guards should have closely supervised the release individuals in the supplementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Authority" and the "Australian Sports Shooters Association," qualified volunteers were selected as part of the association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Heritage and Conservation, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety guidelines and training.
Martili took the oath yesterday in a new temporary electoral council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is Martelli's fifth interim council within four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was like Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in Shawwal.
Protests erupted, sometimes violently, due to the failure to hold the elections scheduled to take place since 1432 AH.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in iPod devices have been reported, which resulted in a total of six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional fatigue incidents, which the company labeled as "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's request to postpone the report by saying, "Very regrettable indeed."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 12:19 AM Mecca time).
The Emergency Management Office in Northern Mariana announced that no damages have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there are no indications of a potential tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, in addition to the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. And Mendoza was shot.
Following in Legen's father's footsteps, he pursued medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then began working at Auckland Women's Hospital in the year 1379 AH.
"Legens" started investigating premature births during his free time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that giving a hormone will accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved the flight recorders, also known as the "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The fellow athletes also praised Luna.
Tomi Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extremist queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, one of a kind."
Dustin "Goldust" Rinerz said, "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe more than me... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the Federal Elections in 1431 AH, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 1429 AH.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 1431 AH federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
Regarding the opposing viewpoints in the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never be a republic.
The physical fitness of the Olympic gold medalist has become questionable due to his complaints. He was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because its use is prohibited during games.
Curtiss Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, discovered the largest known prime number as of Muharram 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various devices and programs, starting with the beginning of the month of Safar, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source for delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed from the impact of comets with Earth a long time ago.
Kumo, 53, who came to power early this year, and a bill legalizing same-sex marriage was passed last month.
He said about the rumors that they were "political gossip and nonsense."
It is likely that he will run for president in the year 1437 AH.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses a technology linked to satellites, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar to allow air observers to pinpoint an aircraft's location with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation options, and the ground trains will not stop at Wembley, in addition to the lack of parking spaces, parking facilities, and drop-off points.
And it raised concerns about a shortage of transportation leading to the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without the presence of fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" mentioned the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the development of new species took only two generations – despite it being believed that this process would take much longer – due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the sharp-billed ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled onto a thin wire that can be wrapped and coiled. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH value of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this value using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H symbol in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of coating.
My city, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, had toilets with flushing mechanisms in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sanitation systems were found in the homes of the cities of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would use them together in mixed company.
When you connect with someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost at the same time.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to place a satellite or telescope in space.
Changing the wheel changed the world in an amazing way; however, the accessibility of a means of transportation that is easier and faster remains the most significant contribution it has made for us.
The train brought us, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
There are more medium-sized cats under them that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the most abundant small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Black cats are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Usually, females are closer to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions operates like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, the animals are similar to lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior and very deadly to their prey.
As a comprehensive athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with a strength five times that of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as the roar of a lion, but it is closer to a shout of angry words.
Dwarf tigers like to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the dwarf tiger hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the Aslot cats track and find prey by scent; they smell where they were on the ground.
She can see well in the dark using night vision, and also move very stealthily. The dwarf tigers hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they migrate across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
Given that this new environment contains diverse resources and competitors, the new group will need different attributes or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to the strength it previously required.
There hasn't been any change whatsoever to the indigenous population; they still need the same adaptation methods as we've grown accustomed to.
As time goes by and new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarities with other residents gradually diminish.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will appear different to the extent that we cannot call them the same kind.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered a deterministic outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breath out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat also comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other Mosasaurs.
The long canines were encrusted with over 70 teeth, resembling blades, in addition to another set in the roof of her mouth, which means there's no escape for anything that stands in her way.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps he had a diversified diet. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may have been a carnivore.
She also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't compare to her.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of unusual or exotic festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
There was another distinction: while the poor and women ate their food sitting on benches, the wealthy men enjoyed hosting feasts together, reclining on their sides while performing their duties.
It was not possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the deities, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods during celebrations and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a secure sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
Sometimes unique towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home did not hold much importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just open stalls overlooking the street. Stone was used in building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Humans inhabited Greenland sparsely. It is said in the Scandinavian sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it as such.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there previously.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," even though each country was "Scandinavian."
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
It was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated 18 Jumada al-Awwal 1190 AH." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The landings on the fateful day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
He ruled Vichy France. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in the year 1359 AH and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On the 15th of Sha'ban 1359 AH, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France, and they were on their way towards Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "citizen," which relates to the Latin "civis," meaning "inhabitant," and "civitas," meaning "city or the state of the city." This also defines a societal cluster in a certain way.
Self-sufficient cities are akin to the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implicitly means the transfer of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially formed a weak central government – with Congress being the sole element within it – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any authority to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
In addition to that, it does not have the authority to exceed the laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The materials required unanimous approval from all states before being amended, and the states scoffed at the central government to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were champions of the FIFA World Cup in the year 1427 AH.
Popular sports in Riyadh include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, المبارزة (fencing), rugby, cycling, ice hockey, luge, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan comprises approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest archipelago in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its journey back in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In the year 1033 AH, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change indigenous grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1094 AH, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1053 AH - 1330 AH) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province under the Qing Empire in the year 1302 AH.
In the year 1312 AH, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (between 1311 AH and 1312 AH), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until the year 1364 AH.
Machu Picchu city consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By the year 1396 AH, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continued until today.
For example, the most common format for still camera photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production continues to this day, but more importantly, the image sensor unit in digital cameras has inherited the aspect ratio.
The 35mm model is a bit confusing, actually. It is 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
Therefore, the dimensions of this image (when divided by 12 to get the ratio for the simplest whole number) will be 3:2.
Many common forms (such as the Advanced Imaging System's set of formats) have an aspect ratio of approximately equal or similar.
The principle of the triple structure, which is often misused and ridiculed, forms a simple guiding principle that works to create dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear form.
It is said that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity united European countries together for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power that it possessed affected everyone, from the king down to ordinary people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the Church exists specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the Church in Rome lasted for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question the extent of faithfulness to the requirements of doctrine.
Soon, Britain took the initiative in blockading Germany by sea after the skirmishes broke out.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off military and civilian vital supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, which was codified and coordinated in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain has monopolized international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, a move that threatens even neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its own unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were peacefulness and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In the year 1301 AH, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison's company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchellor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each era of China or each dynasty in power was of a different kind.
In addition to that, there was between each ruling dynasty an unstable period of divided prefectures. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
A fierce war erupted between many nobles during these periods, in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting to gain control of the highest seats in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just the ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the more ambitious and successful individuals to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because instead of the army's classifications being based on class, they have now become based on weaponry.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in matters that transcend this earthly life. He used to frequent a cave that he came to know as "Hira" on Mount "Al-Noor" for contemplation.
The cave speaks for itself, having remained throughout the ages, offering a vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it is not easy to find him at all, even if you know he exists. Once you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Inside the cave, you can barely see or hear anything from this world.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still remains standing to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era. The Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or the "Giza necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), as well as smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The "high tension" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "low tension" symbol looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
An upward mark indicates starting from the end and pulling the bow, while a downward mark indicates starting from the beginning of the bow (where you grip the bow) and pulling it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to sketch your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed curved marks exist for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), along with the King's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced on the 17th of Muharram in the year 1204 AH to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
A group of fans managed to force the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
A member of the gang once waved the head of a murdered Royal Guard from Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people bore the costs of the United States of America's imperial war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through bank houses and Wall Street.
Of course, the extraordinary profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
We must understand the context and motivation behind the organization's creation in order to comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (390 AH - 700 AH).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which collectively end around the year 893 AH.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive of technology or technological necessity to a strict feeling that the destiny of humankind is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two common, shared ideas in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has "effects" on deeply rooted societies, rather than being linked to society.
For example, one might say that car engines necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, building a road network across the country is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which leads to the innovation of new technologies in healthcare to treat injured bodies.
Romance had a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose. These people, being in harmony with their society's place, were better off than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and continued until 493 AH.
Her situation declined primarily during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusades returned, bringing with them goods like silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of "fashion capital" was bestowed upon Paris instead of Constantinople.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture had a profound influence on clothing in the East.
Despite that, and due to the slow pace of communication channels, patterns in the West may be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of farming carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family only.
Subsistence farming – often organic – is considered a simple system that utilizes stored seeds suited to the region's ecosystem, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, with the aim of increasing yield.
Historically, most Najdi farmers worked in subsistence farming, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures facilitate the connection between individuals with similar ways of thinking and those who feel marginalized due to societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
It is likely that subcultures are distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
Perhaps the characteristics that define the distinctiveness of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures signal their affiliation through the use of various symbolic styles encompassing clothing, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on the few unfortunate cases of children who suffered from neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, and who were socially disconnected from adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "the wild ones" or "lost ones." Some stray children have been detained by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child was abandoned due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Perhaps the abandoned children were subjected to abuse during their childhood or severe traumas before being abandoned or running away.
And others are claimed to have been raised by animals; while it is said that some lived in the wilderness alone.
When a child is raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within material limits) that closely resemble the behaviors of the animal that cared for it, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn't a way of learning, but rather a supporting tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or on-site; and in another sense, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported within the program, and it aims to pose questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on nurturing, care, and education, but they do.
We realize that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they came from previously.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and methods of fulfillment.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personalized participation" and "continuing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings led to significant discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting for a fraction of a second.
It is particularly claimed that one can discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, pointed out that the president's speech suggests that people unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess truthfulness with accuracy.
Indeed, he proposes the idea that these capabilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: one hidden and the other apparent.
The boom introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressional differences.
The processes of separation and reassembly aim to make the variation randomly back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for large mammals with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will lead to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The readily available plant resources in abundance were the proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees solve it in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then sleeping for a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
The other options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positivity life's force bestows. Every person has the inherent ability to find peace and complete contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing hindering us on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it extended through the Mahayana path of love and other Hindu yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces all.
The energy of "Kundalini" (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan Meditation Center is the God of Yoga. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed that this war would continue for the next forty years, and that the fighting on the ground, through proxy armies, would be in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By the 17th of Ramadan in the year 1358 AH, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
Nevertheless, these plans quickly became obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Agreement, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is considered the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition dictates that the role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously preventing your enemy from transporting their people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion, and its main method in this was the use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to invade Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began preserving it for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often herded by goat herders who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherd widely known. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
Carriage roads were established in England in the 16th century.
Although the old railway carts were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and carry heavier loads compared to the roads which were considered even more rugged at that time.
Train tracks were invented relatively early to secure the rails, but it later became clear that placing an iron strip above the track makes it more effective.
That has become a widely adopted custom, although iron led to further wear and tear on the wooden wheels of carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In the year 1181 AH, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a steady manner.
Bipedal species have been found in Australopithecus excavations from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked upright seven million years ago.
We can begin living in a more environmentally sustainable way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and resolve them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancement of humanity, and problems have become greater due to population growth and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Monetary Bulletins."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on the eighth of Rajab.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the sixth of Rajab, and he read it to his troops in New York on the ninth of Rajab. A copy arrived in London on the tenth of Sha'ban.
The twenty-five-fold transcriptions of Donlap represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version was not spared.
Many paleontologists today believe that a single group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many think of her as a dinosaur because she has feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
It has feet with layers of external protection and claws, and it lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
All computers used today rely virtually on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
The value of a binary digit can only be one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits – if we use the conventional language of computers.
Internal poisoning may not show its symptoms immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be built upon symptoms like vomiting, which are general enough.
A good indicator of internal poisoning may be an open container for medication or toxic household chemicals.
Review the poster to learn the first aid instructions specific to the particular poison.
Insect scientists use the term "louse" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have significantly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the "cockroach" and the "bed bug" are characterized by a long incubation period and adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the likelihood of females being affected by multiple sclerosis is twice that of males.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
Within the adoption process, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific methodology. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite that, it is not unique in this regard; experimentation and trial are considered a test that can be used to refute one or more potential hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly the Gospel in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior critically depend, often, on the presence and generation of endogenous cycles through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms have been documented – they are not just responses to external periodic signals – in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are intrinsic oscillators that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either nuclear azides using radioactive phosphorus or the protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations can only be passed on in germline cells to children, whereas mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including flora and fauna.
The examples of activities that can be done at the site include birdwatching, fishing, photography, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, filming, and learning information about this type of monkey (orangutans) in Borneo.
People leave the small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and they meet others working at the place they just left on the other side of the way.
In this vibrant mode of transportation, each person supports and is somewhat connected to a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive, carbon-dependent economy has displaced a biome from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Rarely do you hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of driver and vehicle movement between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a reasonable degree of consistency; as a result, traffic flow exhibits reasonable regularity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better clarify traffic flow, relationships were established between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
In Najd, insects were among the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings backward along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people saw that he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries waters eight times more than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of ancient Egyptian rule, nothing in terms of size and artistic distinction in construction surpassed the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians were amazed in the modern kingdom by the آثار ( آثار ) of their ancestors, which were built for more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language for enacting its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most government employees, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also assumed they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And there are of course minerals like silver and gold as well.
You can also get ingots containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. All matter was created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are extremely small, to the point that trillions of them could occupy the space of the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a less prominent position and use.
People now write letters on computer screens, without needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what might become of the keyboard when something newer than it arrives.
The nuclear fission bomb works on the basis that it gathers energy to form a core filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core cracks again and a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with even simple movement or without any movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is approximately 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to erupt onto the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what interests or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest themselves naturally upon reaching adulthood.
These theories explore what makes some people want the things they do, and the things in their surrounding environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two widely known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors may emerge when managers start leading their former peers: one is an attempt to "fit in" (or to be like the others).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unfavorable decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual transforms into someone unrecognizable, feeling the need to change everything the team was doing and possessed.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same criteria for distinction as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a "hidden team" as a genuine, unique component of a virtual team is described by (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109).
Every member submits their reports to the "Invisible Team." The "Invisible Team" then sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that consumes a lot of time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
When all available resources are utilized effectively through functional departments within the organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
Therefore, synergy within the organization, leading to overcoming obstacles, can result in the emergence of new, innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before the organization can be capable of innovation, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The availability of data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in knowledge inquiry. This, in turn, works to narrow the research area and make it much more precise.
The connection between neurology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to view and explore the structures and processes of the brain in a way we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite the strong connotation of artificial intelligence in science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These kinds of things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now being used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been used to build several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of any school term. Often, the teacher might like to take her students to places that are not typically accessible by bus.
Technology enables solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Also, participating in a virtual field trip is a wonderful way to relive a specific trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their experience with blogs with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to nourish public interest inspires students to be skilled and useful (Toto, 2004).
Documentation is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effective engagement with online materials, students can identify their positions within the context of others' writings in addition to determining their own opinions on specific issues" (O'Raffey, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada, boasting a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and in the north lies the beautiful, undeveloped nature house in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things, and more, highlight Ontario as what is considered to be the essence of Canada by outsiders.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited.
For comparison regarding the population that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States of America is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island in the world, and it's a distinct continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or affiliated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread over a wide range in the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India via the Cape.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, traveling women should declare that they are married.
It's worthwhile wearing a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women must understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may consider harassment, and that it is customary to monitor them and grab them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your position (don't let cultural differences make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used modern Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after its establishment by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1168 AH.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city in the name of Dar al-Badia, and the Spanish traders called it Casablanca, who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places to shop throughout Morocco.
It's easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of cheap merchandise, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 1423 AH, Ghuma was destroyed due to the lava of the Nira Junco volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of "Goma" should be sought to understand the ongoing fighting in the northern Kivu province, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride a boda-boda (which is a motorcycle that works as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides the relative difficulty in reaching it, "Timbuktu" has become used metaphorically for distant, foreign lands.
Timbuktu is currently considered a poor city, despite its reputation that makes it a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In the year 1411 AH, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of Henry Lewis Gates' main stops in the PBS BBC series about the wonders of the African continent.
The city starkly contrasts with the rest of the country's cities because it is characterized by a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, extending along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 square kilometers, and it is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive regions in South Africa, and it is also considered a major park of the national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There are daily fees to maintain the park and enter it, similar to all national parks in South Africa.
It might be useful to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you access to a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the region of Hong Kong its name and is the place many tourists consider their first stop.
The row of buildings resembling those that draw Hong Kong's skyline is like a glittering chart displayed above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the North Point waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal belt of mangrove trees in the world, extending for a distance of 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the remote regions of Bangladesh and India along the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest area located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just swamps for mangrove trees; they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense thickets that once covered the Ganges River plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, with approximately a third of it covered by water/swamps.
Since the year 1385 AH, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates indicate that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inner-city station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bomthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because the buses between neighborhoods are often full, it's better to buy your tickets in advance a few days before.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and strong Japanese "coaster" buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The height of the towers reaches 83 meters, and its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in Sha'ban 1432 AH, and it was not opened to traffic until Rabi' al-Awwal 1438 AH.
It is scheduled for the bridge to begin operating at full capacity in Ramadan 1438 AH, at the same time as the anticipated completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay. The Guarani people lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay originated, which was previously known as the "Giant Province of the Spice Islands" as a result of a confrontation between the Spanish invaders and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 943 AH, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in Dhu al-Hijjah, on polo fields in Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about championships and places to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in Stanley, located on the other side of the Westlake Village FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar are often accepted.
In remote islands, there's a possibility that credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency might be. Check beforehand with the owners to know the accepted payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there occurs when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make the air feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains relatively constant throughout the year, as there are no specifically defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many animals in the garden are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, antelopes, goats, bears, and almost all large animals may attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year due to not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and considered a potential danger, so they must be given their own space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Apolo and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Abia was founded in the 1950s of the 19th century and was the official capital of Samoa since the year 1379 AH.
The port was the site of infamous naval clashes in the year 1306 AH when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British destroyer. Approximately 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by Mao's movement for independence, the peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the Supreme Leader, Tupou Tamesis Liloufi the Third.
Due to Oakland's location between two harbors, there are many beaches, with the most popular ones situated in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by botocua trees.
The beaches of الطرق تاماكي are located on Viaduct Harbour and Watimata, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches can be crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One," as it is not a composite drink, but rather a pleasant and refreshing one. Other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines may have wider distribution.
The tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is "espresso," while a cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam) on top, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are excellent, even though they are expensive.
Numerous trips to the coral reefs are held throughout the year, and injuries to the reefs rarely occur due to any of these reasons.
Nevertheless, seek advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking reassures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Although you might find it possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
It is customary for travel agents to offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests should be directed through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For many festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you must arrive early in order to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main platforms might have ended, there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in the winter, you should check the cabin's location, as crossing over the ice causes extremely loud noise for the most affected people.
The St. Petersburg cruises include some time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from entry visa requirements (see terms and conditions).

During snowstorms, a quantity of snow may fall that is enough to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, icy winds, condensation, or ice on car windows can limit visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered natural in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway has some of the most challenging driving conditions, regularly traversing isolated forested terrains.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and succeeding sections—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
And it's strange that it seems mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other areas stretching along the road, for example, the forests of Pennsylvania.

Indonesian cuisine represents a broad term encompassing a large collection of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, due to the existence of 17,000 islands in Indonesia, leading to diversity among them.
However, if it is used without additional terminology, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of Java Island.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago islands, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply seasoned dishes. The dominant flavors favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili, and sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), along with various fragrant spices.
The saddle supports for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but it can pose safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If the rider falls from the horse but his foot remains caught in the girth, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are several precautions that can be taken to minimize that danger.
First, most riders wear riding boots with very high heels and narrow, soft soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's torso to fall forward from the saddle when it is pulled back upon dismounting.

Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it usually does not involve ice skiing or climbing, as these are practiced on steeply sloped terrain and require stiffer skis and taller boots.
Consider the ice skating trail as a similar route to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances somewhat longer than walking, but you will rarely reach speeds for long-distance snowshoeing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
Despite that, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this region, you can cross the borders generally without needing to go through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each member state of the Schengen Area individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.

Wave currents are the returning flow from waves that break along the shore, often near coral reefs or something like that.
Due to the underwater terrain, the returning flow concentrates in a few deep sections, and a fast current may form towards the deep water there.
Most drowning deaths result from exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you swim outside the current, the swim back will be no less easy than usual.
Try to avoid targeting a place where the current doesn't control you again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone has noticed your presence, waiting for rescue might be another option.
The shock of returning to the homeland is quicker than culture shock (the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.

If they ship things by air freight, it might take several days in some cases for unloading and customs.
Sending parcels as baggage that is inspected was the only way to receive them quickly, but internal airline regulations do not permit sending baggage without a passenger, so it is your turn at this stage.
The obvious way to be able to travel first class or business class is to allocate a large amount of money to obtain this privilege (or it's better for you to have your company arrange it).

The most traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil prayers on Saturday during the end of Holy Week, and gatherings often begin celebrating the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
