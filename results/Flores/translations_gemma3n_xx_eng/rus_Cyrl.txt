This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually impossible to obtain from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top and either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation on the bottom.
The find also allows us to study the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called the rachis, but still possess other distinctive features – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later from other distinctive features through evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers have suggested that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample represents adult plumage, not chick down.
Researchers have suggested that, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has feathers like an adult, not down like a chick.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in a system is determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of a star, related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

The work carried out was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way affect the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is located in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll successfully detected tuberculosis with exceptionally high drug resistance (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said that the new strain "causes great concern because it leads to a very high level of mortality."
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, Dr. Mall thinks, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the entire group of tuberculosis patients still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at this specific time in South Africa.

In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter closes themselves in a booth and places a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, he drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French election laws quite strictly systematize the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the voting process and that no other envelopes have been added except for those of the people allowed to participate in the voting and whose votes have been counted properly.
Candidates may send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

Edgar Vegilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery on his face.
The Uki weapon malfunctioned when aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider feels constant pain; he is blind in one eye, has a portion of his skull missing, and his face has been reconstructed using titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his native country.
Besides the competition on Wednesday, Karpendov participated in two individual events at the championships.
Her first competition was slalom, in the first run of which she didn't reach the finish line. 36 of the 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In the other race, this time a giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in a seated position with a combined time of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Leш and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Dénes Dán.
Four women's sit skiers were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused have the names Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused were presented before the judges with face coverings.
Although three people were inside the building at the moment the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekeye with the murder of her son.
She is being held in custody awaiting charges and a trial, however, any witness testimony could be distorted, as her popularity has been widely exploited by the media.
This is standard practice in other parts of Great Britain, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts deemed the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists appear to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos and other information about suspects."
The Prosecutor General's Office, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until a guilty verdict is handed down.
According to leaked information, the document will concern a dispute over borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The scouts participating in the additional pest control test had to be under close supervision by the rangers, as this test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Within the framework of the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sports Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited during the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Park and Recreation Conservation Service for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the four marksmen selected for the first firearms operation have completed comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Marteyev brought the new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC), consisting of nine members, to an oath.
This is the fifth CEP for Martell in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous interim election council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were triggered by the non-holding of elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in defective iPod devices were reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company called "minor".
In response, the ministry called Apple's report delay "very regrettable."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that there have been no reports of damage in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six have been declared dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of the elderly woman, as she went to the restroom. Mendosa was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital of Oakland in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, in his free time from work, he began to investigate cases of premature birth.
His research showed that introducing the hormone would enhance the maturation of the child's lungs during fetal development.
As reported by Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday, state investigators discovered two flight data recorders, also known as "black boxes."
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna became the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. It's a unique event, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Rannells said: "The moon was just as wicked as I am... Maybe even more wicked... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Out of 1400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal elections, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, expressed the opinion that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are convinced that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believes that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle swims and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is now in doubt.
He couldn't take the medications needed to alleviate the pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25th discovered the largest prime number known to date.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
Perhaps comets were the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic compounds that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called those rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to assurances from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
She is using satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be allowed at Wembley; above-ground trains will not stop there, and there are no surface parking lots or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have led to the assumption that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
The description of a study published on Thursday in the journal Science states that a new species of bird has emerged on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the introduced cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any form. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be woven and plated. It can be stamped or rolled into coils.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books – so-called "face manuscript".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H⁺) in the studied chemical compound.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then mold a ball from this mixture with clean, damp hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, forming an unusual substance, then a shell-like structure will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Preserved fragments of sewage systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and almost instantaneously reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel incredibly changed our world. The most important thing the wheel did for us was give us much lighter and faster transportation.
It provided us with a train, a car, and many other vehicles.
Below them are a larger number of medium-sized cats that eat small to medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including stray domestic cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche concept, the specific work that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as females and offspring, the number of which can reach thirty.
Females typically are related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in their habits (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
A tiger's roar is unlike the resonant roar of a lion, and more resembles the shouting of phrases made up of unintelligible words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the little animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track animals by scent and find prey by following their movements on the ground using their sense of smell.
They have an excellent ability to see in the dark using night vision and move almost silently. Ocelots stalk their prey, blending in with their surroundings, and then pounce.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population they originated from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they migrate to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that differs from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to those it had before in order to become a strong competitor.
The initial population hasn't changed at all—it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it gradually becomes less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, over thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that you wouldn't be able to say they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a crucially important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants get their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. Furthermore, they cast a shadow.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Animals couldn't survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and he also had an extra row of teeth on the palate, so there was no escape for those who crossed his path.
It's not definitely known, but it's not ruled out that his diet was varied. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn't compare to him.
Despite much of their food being familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent like the dormouse.
There was another difference too: while the poor people and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy enjoyed hosting joint feasts during which they ate lying on their sides.
The diet of ancient Romans could not include products that entered Europe from America or Asia in subsequent centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of the gods, considered to be the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods' desires during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called "ziggurats" were built as elements of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of particular importance.
A large part of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Scandinavian sagas tell of Eric the Red's exile from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes had already been living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence depicted a treasure map.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence it is written: "The present Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for easier storage.
Thus, it's quite likely that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
He was under the control of "Vichy" Frenchmen. These Frenchmen concluded a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the occupiers instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just 2 weeks, the forces of the Free French and the Americans liberated southern France and moved towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, the bearers of which are a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "citizen," and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also expresses a certain dimension of the size of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuous cultural presence, and a transferable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, впервые formed a weak central government, the sole organ of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, which often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all of its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments require unanimous approval from all states, but the states have been so irresponsible toward the central government that their representatives often were absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of these regions in Italy participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to its belonging to the island cluster/group, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan dates back many years, to the 15th century, when European navigators passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and, in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for still photographs is 35 mm, and it was this size that dominated film during the twilight of the analog era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from the dimensions of digital camera images.
The 35-mm format is actually a bit confusing; it has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio of small integers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or closely approximate these proportions.
The too-often-used and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in an image.
It states that it's best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone – from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of church authority was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was upheld.
Shortly after the start of the war, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proven effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws outlined in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and peoples in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batcheller, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique method of denoting periods of time was used; each stage of China or each family in power was a special dynasty.
Furthermore, there was fragmentation and instability between the reigns of each dynasty. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many prominent figures fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous such social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as ranks now are based on qualities rather than on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
Well, and the cave that has survived to this day gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
She is very difficult to detect, even for someone who knows of her existence. In the cave, a person finds themselves in complete isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and a multitude of surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
A bow-up motion looks like a V, and a bow-down motion looks like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
"Up" means you should start from the tip and draw the bow forward, while "down" means you should start from where your hand holds the bow and draw it back.
Moving the bow upwards typically produces a softer sound, while moving the bow downwards produces a louder and more forceful sound.
You can draw your own hatching, but remember that the hatching is printed for musical reasons and it is usually best to follow it.
On October 6, 1789, an enraged mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles, where they had fled in terror.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people made the King and Queen widely open the windows.
At one point, a member of this crowd waved his hand like a member of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of expenses and interest on bond loans, channeled on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking firms.
Of course, the superprofits generated by the long exploitation of Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that motivated them to create the order.
The period in which these events occurred is conventionally called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the generally accepted view, ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative to the strict viewpoint that people's destinies are driven by a fundamental logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technologies.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually immune to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is an indispensable factor in the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unfavorable only for a small group of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed that allow reducing the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road traffic accidents, which in turn drives the development of new treatments in healthcare for injuries sustained in these accidents.
Romanticism largely incorporated cultural determinism, drawing inspiration from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures associated with it emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the capital of modern fashion, so Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the time of feudal Europe.
Fame about him as the center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century primarily because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more highly valued than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
At that moment, the title of the Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25-30 years.
Individual styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Sustainable agriculture is farming conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and their family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds grown in the local ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for sustenance, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel stifled by societal standards, and allow these individuals to define who they are.
Between subcultures, differences are possible, conditioned by the age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people who make them up.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their affiliation through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to present several regrettable cases where children, due to a lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, did not interact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wild" or "feral." Some feral children isolated themselves from people (usually their own parents). In some cases, this abandonment of a child was the result of parents' inability to accept their child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild independently.
If a child is completely raised by animals instead of humans, the feral child will display behaviors (within physical limitations) similar in almost every way to the specific animal that raised him – for example, his fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of support for those going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffolding, designed to aid learning, is built into the software and intended to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that a learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed under guardianship for a multitude of diverse reasons: ranging from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where they are not provided with upbringing, care, and education, yet they do.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach to usage and satisfaction.
So, the idea has been put forward that "education" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contacts" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people react to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions – facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of their microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Voice," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, animals, such as domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffle variations between the two pools.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be squirrels found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also represent a rich source of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything said above, it shouldn't be surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees solve it in the savanna to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock to rouse you without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include consuming large amounts of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force present within you. Every person is potentially given the ability to achieve absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a variety of techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
The energy of Kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations in Kundalini Yoga.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, contradictions regarding the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She had 40 more years to live. She fought genuinely in it, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became irrelevant practically overnight when approximately 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is, undoubtedly, the most efficient way to move a large number of people and cargo across oceans.
The work of sailors traditionally consists of ensuring the country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was a company in the North Atlantic during World War II. Americans attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves in order to have milk, wool, meat, and hides readily available.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, which were often tended by shepherds – usually children or teenagers, resembling a more common form of shepherding. These grazing methods are still used today.
Roads for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the cart tracks were merely placed wooden beams parallel to each other, they allowed horses to transport heavier loads and at a greater speed than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Sleepers began to be used quite a long time ago to hold the rails in place. However, it later became clear that the tracks were more effective with an iron plate on top.
This has become common practice, but the metal was causing increased wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transport was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
For their ancestors, the Australopithecus, bipedalism was not so habitual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the 4.2–3.9 million-year-old period, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living by caring more about the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement and even be activists to alleviate future suffering, at least a little.
As a rule, this is similar to treating symptoms. If we need not just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root cause of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly under the influence of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people, the problems have become more widespread.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent several blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
150–200 copies were produced overnight, now known as "Dunlap leaflets".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in Independence Hall courtyard on July 8th.
On July 6th, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9th ordered it to be read aloud to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlop leaflets, known to date, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not reached us.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But much more could be said about birds, which still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly paws with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" – or "bits" if using computer jargon.
It may be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Please refer to the label, which provides specific first aid instructions for poisoning by this particular toxin.
The term "beetle" is used formally by entomologists to denote a group of insects.
This concept originates from the well-known bed bugs of ancient times – insects perfectly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to living in a nest or the dwelling of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been discovered in the US, making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not align with their interests or their child's interests.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption or foster care, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world is structured by applying the scientific method. This method essentially forms the basis of most scientific research.
However, he is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), posing questions, and conducting observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West became disconnected from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic stimuli, have been registered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue their autonomous cyclicality for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, i.e., viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide range of diverse outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the cells affected by the mutation are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Among the examples of recreational activities available at the site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
A good example is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplaces, while others pass by on their way to where they just came from.
In this active traffic movement, everyone is connected to and supports the system of transportation based on personal automobiles, in one way or another.
Currently, science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has impacted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about the transport systems, why do they break down daily? Is it simply that transport engineers are incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of traffic flow research.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of vehicle traffic because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often sufficiently systematic; therefore, traffic flows as a whole have some degree of systematicity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies, find food, and locate mates more easily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Dragonflies and stick insects are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that sometimes reaches six miles.
A whole 20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
In the new realm of the ancient Egyptians, they admired monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language for most people working in the government, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transition to a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys, in essence, are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain a small amount of such non-metallic elements as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of the smallest particles, called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into a single period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It's sad that when new writing methods appeared, the pencil lost its former status and was used less.
Now people write messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
It's only possible to guess what will happen to the keyboard with the emergence of newer technologies.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed for many protons and neutrons to be located in one nucleus.
It's roughly like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Then, the secondary fission of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to decay with or without external influence.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
She is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the visible side, there might be more lunar maria because the crust is thinner there. It would have been easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people to act or what can interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate within them during the process of growing up.
These theories address what motivates specific people to do what they do, and what their surroundings compel them to do or not do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, two types of behavior may manifest when managers start leading people who were previously their equals in status. One extreme of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, evaluate work results, distribute responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team did and claim it as their own.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are typically more autonomous than employees in traditional teams, because their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management doesn't always understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a team of leaders that each participant reports to. The Invisible Team sets standards for each participant.
Why should an organization go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional units of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Ultimately, the organization's concerted effort to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the client's interests.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Engel (2006) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying consciousness. This narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large volume of data and materials for creating simulation models that help understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is shaping a very important area of computer science, which examines the behavior and learning of machines and the "imbuing" them with intelligence.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines for automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be given: monitoring, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and client questions, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
Similar questions are addressed in separate disciplines, the aim of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being integrated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. Teachers very often want to take their students somewhere that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can examine museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Publishing a tour in a virtual space for public viewing is also an excellent way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your acquired knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and the site is updated each year, but access to old versions is still preserved—they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, keeping a blog "helps students better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration, and it motivates students to extend the knowledge acquisition process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their position within the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oraviak, 2002).
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a vast number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising comparison of population numbers: there are more African Americans in the USA than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than other places and is an original continent when it comes to wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this region, particularly where it took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west – by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may perceive friendly gestures as harassment, and women are often followed, have their arms grabbed, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 1st century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city called Eddar-el-Baid, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole assortment of trinkets, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is advisable to check information in advance regarding any travel outside of Goma to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild here at one of the most affordable prices in Africa.
You can go around Goma by boda-boda (motor taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat from desert sand.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Africa's Wonders," one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is significantly different from other cities in the country because it has a predominantly Arab flavor rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north; its southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park's area is 19,500 km²; it includes 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for various wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading one among South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, this park has a daily fee for conservation and entry.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to South Africa's national parks either selectively or to all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
A string of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline is compared to a glittering bar graph, highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque spots in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of Lamma Island, which is opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong's development districts are concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern shore, which was recovered from the sea.
This is a place that the British colonizers claimed for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, then this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A portion of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps—they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 sq km, of which approximately one-third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and current estimates indicate that 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer currently inhabit its territory.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and reliable Japanese Coaster buses.
A minibus is a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The height of the underbridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully commissioned in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the region that now occupies eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced swidden agriculture.
The Chaco region served as home to various local tribes, such as the Guayкуру and Payaguas, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "vast province of the East Indies," arose as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries. **Note:** The original sentence was in Spanish, not Russian. I have translated the Spanish sentence provided.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here at a different time of year.
To find out about polo match news and where to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley across from the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands. Credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency might be; clarify in advance with the owners which method of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, air temperatures above +30°C are commonplace.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and air humidity creates a feeling of colder weather compared to what the thermometer shows.
There aren't really distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is roughly the same all year round.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves within 100 yards/meters, and do not approach all other wild animals within 25 yards/meters!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't maintain the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Furthermore, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid preparing or carrying odorous food, and also keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, with the exception of one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German sailors perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Here are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees like the pohutukawa.
In the central district of Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers are located in Waitematā Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive stretch out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One," which has a simple, pleasant, and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that can be drunk, however, New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're still worried, it won't be difficult to find bottled water.
Australians don't understand the idea of a "flat white." A "small black" is espresso; they serve cappuccino with a thick layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
A large number of trips are made to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
However, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can sometimes be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking allows travelers to not worry about where to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages including flights and hotel accommodation.
Furthermore, they can hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the overwhelming majority of attendees camp directly on the festival grounds, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages might already end, there might be areas at the festival where music will continue to play late into the night.
At some festivals, there are special camping zones for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the cabin location, as traveling over ice creates a rather eerie noise that can disturb those who are most sensitive to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please clarify the conditions).
Usually, casinos do everything possible to ensure visitors spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible within the establishment. There are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They typically offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay at the establishment.
In some establishments, they offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is planning to travel through high-latitude regions or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you won't be able to drive a car the same way you would on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause people to get stranded.
Visibility can also be limited due to snowfall, blizzard, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues around the clock with almost no interruptions year-round.
Safari is probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and a major event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday use refers to a land trip with the purpose of viewing amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so even with ordinary equipment you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be cautious, so you should observe them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bushwalking," "hiking safari," or "foot trek") consists of a trek lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. They were first held here in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date change was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Order cancellation rules may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or aren't keen on the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to excessively high temperatures (which may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it's enough to boil water for a minute, while in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective in different ways, and if in doubt, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter invasive species that they haven't seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, even worse, trigger allergic reactions, secrete toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of causing injury or death to humans, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in specific locations without taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermon has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, remote, and forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than anything else.
However, strangely enough, the mobile phone signal here is much better than in many other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good. In Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and diverse and resemble the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apple pastries are available year-round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
In German pastries, almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling pastries, try what is called either blini or filled doughnuts, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and North India, yogurt is actively used in curries. In South India and certain coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Indonesian cuisine, encompassing 17,000 islands, is a general term used to describe the vast diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, without clarification, this term most often implies food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, widely popular throughout the archipelago today, features a selection of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese people prefer flavor enhancers such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are footrests for a rider, hanging from both sides of a saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues as there is a risk of the foot getting caught.
If a horse throws off its rider, but their foot is caught in the stirrup, the galloping horse can drag them along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with heels, featuring a smooth and relatively thin sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that prevent the leather stirrup from being pulled off the saddle if the rider falls backward.
The Cochamó Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
From the top, you can enjoy breathtaking mountain views. Climbers from around the world constantly create new routes in its vast potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Alpine skiing is a major tourist attraction for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes also called "skiing slackers"), who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but usually doesn't include hiking to the summit and then skiing down unprepared slopes, as skiing on untouched snow requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski route is a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than when walking, but you can only achieve such speed on cross-country skis in extremely rare cases, when you don't have a heavy backpack and there's a prepared track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would require applying for visas and repeatedly going through passport control.
But the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
Being in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the member states of the Schengen Agreement separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid bureaucratic hassle.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, in which the age limit in places like North America can be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft items can be classified as antiques, despite being younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although that is the tradition, not all members of the Sami people were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar trades, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi people are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If warnings about the dangers of visiting a country you plan to visit are in place, this may affect your travel medical insurance during the trip or your trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you should also consult with other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are aimed at their own citizens.
Here's one example: US citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot.
Informational messages only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The expressed opinions are often superficial, vague, and overly simplified compared to the widely available more detailed information.
Adverse weather conditions is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing some damage, causing serious social disruption, or leading to human casualties.
Adverse weather conditions occur everywhere around the world, and they come in various forms, depending on the geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to consider any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that could be considered an area of military conflict must undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "course on safety in a hostile environment" may yield the address of a local company.
In-depth courses usually examine all the topics covered here much more thoroughly, often with practical training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing scenarios, a large amount of information on first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies in different places.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is just as varied.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become much more thorough since the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals preparing for surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip current - a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The return flow is concentrated in several deeper areas where a rapid current can form, extending to greater depths, due to the underwater topography.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try going somewhere you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to one's native country occurs earlier than culture shock (there's a shorter, more romantic period here), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people likely treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in the quiet before the show begins.
Usually, there's always a noise from tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx acts as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes show the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which were opened in 1819. There are more bases located on these islands than anywhere else, and in 2020, sixteen were operational.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George and has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingstone and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano, which is active to this day, forms an impressive natural harbor.
Elsweir Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Elsweir mountain range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier into two parts.
In the northern part, that is on the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica – the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote locations where mobile phone service is unavailable, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors in a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transfer and voice communication.
As a rule, you can get more information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
A growing trend for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a sabbatical can indeed increase your chances of getting into higher education institutions in your home country.
As a rule, there is a tuition fee for admission to such educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating tourism. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can quite easily manage without a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak leave a completely different impression.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland. Specifically, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stop in Russian St. Petersburg.
This means you can spend several full days in this historic city, and for overnight stays, return to the ship.
If you only go to the shore as part of a ship excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
In some cruise brochures, Berlin, Germany is featured. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for a person of any age and social status, especially if it's their first flight or if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.
There's no reason to be ashamed of it: it's no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear that arises from uncertainty or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Delivery speed for commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is often very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but smaller companies have had problems with this on other routes.
If they shipped anything as air cargo, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as registered baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, so we need your participation here.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to open your wallet for the privilege (or, better yet, to get your company to pay for you).
However, it's not cheap at all – based on experience, roughly speaking, you'll pay four times more than the usual economy class for business class and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there's no point even looking for discounts on business or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a specific core group of passengers who are willing to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has become a victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The primary religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million people, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once a venerable ancient city, Smyrna today is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, modern shopping centers alternate with traditional roofs of red tiles, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldorskviik, there is a view of the nearby island of Estura, and an unusual octagonal church is also located there.
On the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some of the graves.
It's worth spending half an hour to take a walk through an unusual village.
Sintra, a romantic and charming town located relatively not far to the north, was celebrated by Lord Byron and subsequently gained worldwide fame.

Please remember that you are, in principle, standing in a mass grave, as well as in a place that is indescribably important to a considerable percentage of the inhabitants of the globe.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or died from overwork while working here, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and Nazis.
Do not deface this place by applying or scratching graffiti on objects around it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan, as it is legally the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
Regular advertisements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, like a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person. This will significantly ease your adaptation to the city.
The unfriendly appearance of Parisians will instantly disappear if you show a little elementary politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and represents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the combination of microclimates, diverse soils, and elevation changes, it boasts an especially wide variety of plant communities.
The area is teeming with a huge variety of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare representatives of the fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and hazel grouse, as well as many other common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts below the knee and have their shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, robes are provided for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
They can be taken upon entry as well, however this clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might find these skirts uncomfortable. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, as well as that of similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with the ubiquitous use of olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in the summer, is Pan amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any filling you have on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie," meaning You, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and objects.
This also likely simplifies reading, while writing becomes somewhat more complicated because it's necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.

However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and doesn't need to be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are typically considered outdated today and now serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't such a problem during their flowering period as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses that are easier to reach than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called "hanami," became part of Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the plum blossom was a favorite flower.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossoms were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take even just one specimen.
Visiting an officially organized garden and collecting "samples" will also result in you being kicked out without any discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to navigate, and almost anything can be bought upon arrival.
But, even being in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (in clear skies, less often).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron – the legendary site of burial of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are getting on is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good theme for holding some kind of celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a cruise along the Danube's sights, or a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular pedestrian and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by those not belonging to Christianity worldwide.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter holidays, with parishioners typically beginning the celebration of the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying, or being washed ashore by the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not reach there, which makes the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will learn what a polar night is – when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and, as a result, light pollution is often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued more than individual achievements.
